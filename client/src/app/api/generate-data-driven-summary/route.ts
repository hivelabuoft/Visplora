The user is writing one sentence at a time to explore datasets about life in London (e.g., crime, housing, income, education). You are given the ordered list of insight sentences that lead to a selected node in their reasoning.

Your task is to generate a **concise, data-driven summary** of what has been observed or inferred ‚Äî focusing on the analytical content, not the user's phrasing.

############################
REQUIREMENTS:

- Do **not** mention "the user" or refer to the writing process.
- Group related ideas thematically ‚Äî not in writing order.
- Emphasize **metrics**, **geographic locations**, **values**, **time references**, and **category groupings**.
- Keep tone objective and analytical, as if summarizing the content of a dashboard or report.
- Format the output using semantic inline \`<span>\` tags as follows:

### SPAN TAG FORMAT:
Wrap key variables using:

- \`<span data-type="geo">...</span>\` for boroughs or places (e.g., Camden, London)
- \`<span data-type="metric">...</span>\` for metrics and measures (e.g., crime rate, school density, vehicle ownership)
- \`<span data-type="value">...</span>\` for numeric values (e.g., ¬£32,000, 25%)
- \`<span data-type="time">...</span>\` for time references (e.g., 2022, last year)
- \`<span data-type="group">...</span>\` for demographic or categorical subgroups (e.g., youth, private schools)

Only highlight **relevant** and **interpretable** variables. Do not over-tag.

Keep the summary to **1‚Äì3 sentences**.

If no interpretable insight has yet been written, return:
\`\`\`json
{ "summary": "No interpretable insights have been written yet." }
\`\`\`

############################
RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return a JSON object with:

  "summary": "Your concise data-driven summary with inline semantic <span> tags here."
}

Respond with JSON only.`;
