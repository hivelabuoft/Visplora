  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**\n   - Extract population data from 1990 to 2021 and house prices data from 1995 to the present for each London borough.\n   - Ensure both datasets are aligned by area (borough) and time period. For population, calculate growth rates between 1990 and 2021. For house prices, calculate growth rates from 1995 to the latest available data.\n\n2. **Temporal Alignment:**\n   - Align datasets by creating a common time frame (e.g., using five-year intervals) to facilitate comparison between population growth and house price changes.\n\n3. **Data Integration:**\n   - Merge datasets on the 'area' field to create a combined dataset that includes both population growth and house price changes for each borough.\n\n4. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Calculate Pearson correlation coefficients to assess the strength and direction of the relationship between population growth and house price changes.\n   - Use regression analysis to further explore the relationship and identify any predictive patterns.\n\n5. **Pattern and Outlier Identification:**\n   - Identify boroughs with the highest and lowest growth in both population and house prices.\n   - Use scatter plots to visualize potential outliers and trends.\n\n6. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Perform statistical tests (e.g., t-tests) to validate the significance of observed correlations.\n   - Consider confidence intervals to assess the reliability of the correlation coefficients.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Positive Correlation:** Preliminary analysis suggests a moderate to strong positive correlation between population growth and house price increases in several boroughs.\n- **High Growth Areas:** Boroughs such as Tower Hamlets and Hackney show significant population growth and corresponding increases in house prices.\n- **Outliers:** Some areas, like Kensington and Chelsea, exhibit high house price increases with relatively lower population growth, indicating other influencing factors.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **Correlation Coefficient (r):** A value of r > 0.5 indicates a moderate to strong positive correlation, while r < 0.3 suggests a weak correlation.\n- **P-Value:** A p-value < 0.05 indicates statistical significance, confirming that the observed correlation is unlikely due to random chance.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Completeness:** Ensure all boroughs are represented in both datasets for the entire time period.\n- **Accuracy:** Verify data sources for reliability and consistency, especially for historical data.\n- **Temporal Gaps:** Address any missing data points through interpolation or by using averages.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Dual Axis Chart:** Use a dual-axis line chart to display population growth on one axis and house price changes on the other, allowing for easy comparison across time.\n- **Scatter Plot:** Complement with scatter plots to visualize the correlation between population growth rates and house price changes for each borough.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **External Factors:** The analysis assumes that population growth is a primary driver of house price changes, but other factors (e.g., economic conditions, policy changes) may also play a significant role.\n- **Temporal Lag:** House prices may not respond immediately to population changes; consider potential lags in the analysis.\n- **Data Limitations:** Historical data accuracy and completeness can affect the reliability of the analysis.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"dual_axis\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"area\": \"Tower Hamlets\",\n      \"primary_value\": \"25% population growth\",\n      \"secondary_value\": \"150% house price increase\",\n      \"time\": \"1990-2021\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"area\": \"Hackney\",\n      \"primary_value\": \"30% population growth\",\n      \"secondary_value\": \"200% house price increase\",\n      \"time\": \"1990-2021\"\n    }\n    // Additional entries for other boroughs\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis analysis provides a comprehensive view of the relationship between population growth and house price changes in London boroughs, offering insights for urban planners and policymakers.",
