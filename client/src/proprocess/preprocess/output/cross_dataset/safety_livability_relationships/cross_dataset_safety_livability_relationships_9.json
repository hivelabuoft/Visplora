  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**\n   - Extract crime rates data for each borough in London for the years 2022-2023 using the provided query. This includes the borough name, crime category, and count.\n   - Extract private rent data for the same period, focusing on rent prices and the corresponding area.\n   - Ensure that both datasets are cleaned and standardized, particularly focusing on matching borough names/areas between the datasets.\n\n2. **Data Integration:**\n   - Perform a join operation on the datasets using the borough/area as the key. This will align crime rates with private rent prices for each borough.\n   - Aggregate crime data to get a total crime count per borough, as the analysis focuses on overall crime rates rather than specific categories.\n\n3. **Temporal Alignment:**\n   - Since both datasets cover the same time period (2022-2023), ensure that any temporal discrepancies (e.g., monthly vs. yearly data) are resolved by aggregating data to a common time frame if necessary.\n\n4. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the aggregated crime rates and average private rent prices for each borough. This will quantify the strength and direction of the relationship.\n   - Visualize the relationship using a scatter plot, plotting crime rates on the x-axis and private rent prices on the y-axis.\n\n5. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Conduct a hypothesis test to determine the statistical significance of the correlation. Typically, a p-value less than 0.05 indicates a significant correlation.\n   - Identify any outliers that may skew the correlation and assess their impact on the analysis.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Coefficient:** The Pearson correlation coefficient will indicate whether there is a negative correlation (as proposed) between crime rates and private rent prices.\n- **Significant Patterns:** If a significant negative correlation is found, it suggests that boroughs with higher crime rates tend to have lower private rent prices.\n- **Outliers:** Identify any boroughs that deviate significantly from the trend, which may indicate unique local factors affecting rent prices or crime rates.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **P-Value:** Calculate the p-value associated with the correlation coefficient to assess statistical significance.\n- **Confidence Interval:** Provide a confidence interval for the correlation coefficient to understand the range within which the true correlation likely falls.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Data Completeness:** Ensure that all boroughs are represented in both datasets and that there are no missing values that could bias the analysis.\n- **Data Consistency:** Verify that the crime categories and rent categories are consistently defined and reported across the datasets.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Scatter Plot:** Create a scatter plot with crime rates on the x-axis and private rent prices on the y-axis. Each point represents a borough.\n- **Trend Line:** Add a trend line to the scatter plot to visualize the overall direction of the relationship.\n- **Annotations:** Highlight any outliers or particularly interesting boroughs with annotations.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Causality:** The analysis identifies correlation, not causation. Other factors may influence both crime rates and rent prices.\n- **Data Granularity:** The analysis assumes that borough-level data is sufficiently granular to capture meaningful patterns.\n- **Temporal Effects:** The analysis assumes that the relationship between crime rates and rent prices is stable over the 2022-2023 period.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"scatter\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"x\": \"crime-rates_value\",\n      \"y\": \"private-rent_value\",\n      \"borough\": \"area_name\",\n      \"dataset1\": \"crime-rates\",\n      \"dataset2\": \"private-rent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis structure will be used to generate the scatter plot, facilitating the visualization of the relationship between crime rates and private rent prices across London boroughs.",
