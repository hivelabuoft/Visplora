  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n#### Data Preparation\n1. **Data Extraction**: Extract income and house price data for London boroughs from 2019 to 2023 using the provided SQL queries.\n2. **Data Cleaning**: Ensure consistency in borough names and handle any missing or anomalous data points.\n3. **Temporal Alignment**: Aggregate data annually to match income data (yearly) with house price data (monthly). Calculate the average house price for each borough per year.\n\n#### Data Integration\n1. **Join Datasets**: Merge the income and house price datasets on the 'Area' field, ensuring that each borough's data is aligned by year.\n2. **Calculate Growth Rates**: Compute the percentage change in mean income and average house prices from 2019 to 2023 for each borough.\n\n#### Correlation Analysis\n1. **Correlation Coefficient**: Use Pearson correlation to quantify the relationship between income growth and house price appreciation across boroughs.\n2. **Scatter Plot Visualization**: Create a scatter plot with income growth on the x-axis and house price growth on the y-axis, with each point representing a borough.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n1. **Correlation Results**: Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient to determine the strength and direction of the relationship between income growth and house price appreciation.\n2. **Pattern Identification**: Identify any clusters of boroughs that exhibit similar trends or significant outliers that deviate from the general pattern.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n1. **P-Value**: Calculate the p-value associated with the Pearson correlation to assess the statistical significance of the observed correlation.\n2. **Confidence Intervals**: Provide confidence intervals for the correlation coefficient to understand the precision of the estimate.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n1. **Data Completeness**: Ensure that all boroughs have complete data for the analysis period. Address any missing data through imputation or exclusion.\n2. **Data Consistency**: Verify that income and house price data are consistently reported across years and boroughs.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Scatter Plot**: Use a scatter plot to visually represent the correlation between income growth and house price appreciation. Include a trend line to highlight the overall relationship.\n- **Color Coding**: Differentiate boroughs by color to identify potential clusters or outliers easily.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n1. **Temporal Aggregation**: Aggregating monthly house price data to annual averages may obscure short-term fluctuations.\n2. **Causality**: Correlation does not imply causation. The analysis identifies relationships but does not establish cause-and-effect.\n3. **External Factors**: Consider external economic factors (e.g., interest rates, government policies) that might influence both income and house prices independently.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"scatter\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"x\": \"income_value\",\n      \"y\": \"house-prices_value\",\n      \"borough\": \"area_name\",\n      \"dataset1\": \"income\",\n      \"dataset2\": \"house-prices\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis analysis aims to provide insights into the relationship between income growth and house price appreciation across London boroughs. By understanding these dynamics, stakeholders can make informed decisions regarding urban development, investment, and policy-making. The findings will highlight whether high-income growth areas are indeed experiencing significant house price increases, contributing to a broader understanding of urban economic trends.",
