  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**\n   - Extract restaurant data for each borough from 2001 to 2017, focusing on the number of restaurants (`restaurant_count`) and categorizing by `cuisine_type`.\n   - Extract income data for each borough from 1999 to 2023, focusing on `mean_income`.\n\n2. **Data Alignment and Integration:**\n   - Align the datasets by matching borough names (`area` in restaurants data and `Area` in income data).\n   - Use a temporal lag approach to align the restaurant data (2001-2017) with income data (1999-2023). This involves considering the potential lag effect of restaurant growth on income growth.\n\n3. **Correlation and Statistical Analysis:**\n   - Calculate the correlation between the number of restaurants and income growth using Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients, depending on data distribution.\n   - Perform a time-lagged regression analysis to assess the impact of restaurant growth on subsequent income changes.\n\n4. **Pattern and Outlier Identification:**\n   - Identify trends and patterns in the data using line charts to visualize the relationship over time.\n   - Detect outliers or boroughs with significant deviations from the general trend.\n\n5. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Conduct hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests) to determine the statistical significance of the observed correlations.\n   - Use confidence intervals to assess the reliability of the correlation coefficients.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Analysis:**\n  - A moderate to strong positive correlation is expected between the number of restaurants and income growth in several boroughs, indicating that areas with more restaurants tend to experience higher income growth.\n  - Specific boroughs such as Westminster and Camden may show stronger correlations due to their central locations and higher restaurant density.\n\n- **Temporal Lag Impact:**\n  - The time-lagged analysis may reveal that increases in restaurant numbers precede income growth by a few years, supporting the proposition that restaurant growth can drive economic development.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **Correlation Coefficient (r):** A value between 0.3 to 0.7 may indicate a moderate correlation, while values above 0.7 suggest a strong correlation.\n- **p-value:** A p-value less than 0.05 would indicate statistical significance, suggesting that the observed correlation is unlikely to be due to chance.\n- **Confidence Intervals:** Narrow confidence intervals around the correlation coefficient would indicate high reliability.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Completeness:** Ensure that both datasets cover the same boroughs and time periods without missing data.\n- **Consistency:** Verify that the data definitions and units are consistent across datasets.\n- **Accuracy:** Cross-validate data with external sources if possible to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Line Chart:** Use a dual-axis line chart to plot the number of restaurants and mean income over time for each borough. This allows for easy comparison of trends.\n- **Interactive Features:** Implement interactive elements to allow users to select specific boroughs and time periods for detailed analysis.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Causality vs. Correlation:** The analysis identifies correlations but cannot definitively establish causality between restaurant growth and income changes.\n- **Temporal Lag Assumptions:** The chosen lag period may not capture all dynamics of the relationship; different boroughs may have different lag periods.\n- **External Factors:** Other factors influencing income growth, such as policy changes or economic conditions, are not accounted for in this analysis.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"line\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"time\": \"2001-2017\",\n      \"value1\": \"restaurant_count\",\n      \"value2\": \"mean_income\",\n      \"area\": \"Borough Name\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis structure allows for visual representation of the relationship between restaurant growth and income changes over time, providing insights into the economic dynamics of London boroughs.",
