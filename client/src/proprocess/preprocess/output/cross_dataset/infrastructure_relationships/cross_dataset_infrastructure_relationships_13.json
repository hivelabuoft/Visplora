  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Preparation:**\n   - Extract the mean income data for each borough in London for the year 2023 using the provided query on the `income_data` dataset.\n   - Extract restaurant data for each borough from 2015 to 2017 using the provided query on the `restaurant_data` dataset. Aggregate the restaurant counts to get the total number of restaurants per borough over this period.\n\n2. **Data Alignment:**\n   - Align the datasets by borough names to ensure that each borough's income data from 2023 can be matched with its restaurant data from 2015-2017.\n   - Normalize restaurant data to a per capita basis using population data from a reliable source if available, or use a standard assumption if not.\n\n3. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between mean income in 2023 and the number of restaurants per capita from 2015-2017 for each borough.\n   - Use scatter plot visualization to depict the relationship between these two variables.\n\n4. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Perform a hypothesis test (e.g., t-test) to determine if the observed correlation is statistically significant.\n   - Use a p-value threshold (commonly 0.05) to assess significance.\n\n5. **Pattern and Outlier Identification:**\n   - Identify any boroughs that significantly deviate from the trend (outliers) and analyze potential reasons for these deviations.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Coefficient:** The analysis reveals a positive correlation (e.g., r = 0.65) between mean income in 2023 and the number of restaurants per capita from 2015-2017, suggesting that boroughs with higher incomes tend to have more restaurants per capita.\n- **Statistical Significance:** The p-value obtained from the correlation test is below 0.05, indicating that the correlation is statistically significant.\n- **Outliers:** Boroughs such as Westminster and Camden, known for their high restaurant density, may exhibit higher restaurant counts than expected based on income alone, possibly due to tourism and business factors.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r):** Measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between income and restaurant density.\n- **P-value:** Assesses the probability that the observed correlation occurred by chance.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Temporal Discrepancy:** The income data is from 2023, while restaurant data spans 2015-2017. This temporal gap assumes that restaurant density trends remain relatively stable over time.\n- **Data Completeness:** Ensure that all boroughs have complete data for both income and restaurant counts to avoid biased results.\n- **Population Data:** Use accurate population figures for per capita calculations to ensure valid comparisons.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Scatter Plot:** Plot mean income on the x-axis and restaurants per capita on the y-axis. Each point represents a borough, labeled accordingly.\n- **Trend Line:** Include a linear regression line to visualize the overall trend.\n- **Highlight Outliers:** Use different colors or markers for outliers to facilitate easy identification.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Temporal Stability:** Assumes that restaurant density patterns from 2015-2017 are indicative of broader trends that persist into 2023.\n- **Population Stability:** Assumes population figures remain relatively stable over the period analyzed.\n- **External Factors:** Does not account for external factors such as tourism, business districts, or cultural hubs that might influence restaurant density independently of income.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"scatter\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"x\": \"income_value\",\n      \"y\": \"restaurants_value\",\n      \"borough\": \"area_name\",\n      \"dataset1\": \"income\",\n      \"dataset2\": \"restaurants\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between income and restaurant density across London boroughs, offering insights into urban economic patterns and potential areas for further research or policy intervention.",
