  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:**\n   - Extract data from the ethnicity dataset using the provided SQL query to get the percentage of Asian Indian ethnicity for each LSOA (Lower Layer Super Output Area) in London for the year 2021.\n   - Extract data from the income dataset using the provided SQL query to get the mean income for each area in London for the year 2023.\n   - Ensure both datasets have a common identifier for joining. In this case, the `LSOA_code` from the ethnicity dataset and `Area` from the income dataset should be aligned.\n\n2. **Data Joining:**\n   - Perform an inner join on the two datasets using the common identifier (`LSOA_code`/`Area`) to create a unified dataset that contains both the percentage of Asian Indian ethnicity and mean income for each area.\n\n3. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the percentage of Asian Indian ethnicity and mean income to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship.\n   - Use scatter plot visualization to visually assess the relationship between the two variables.\n\n4. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Conduct a hypothesis test to determine the statistical significance of the correlation. Typically, a p-value less than 0.05 indicates a statistically significant correlation.\n\n5. **Pattern and Outlier Identification:**\n   - Identify any significant patterns or outliers in the scatter plot that may indicate areas with unusual data points.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Coefficient:** The analysis reveals a Pearson correlation coefficient of `r`, indicating the strength and direction of the relationship between Asian Indian ethnicity percentage and mean income.\n- **Statistical Significance:** The p-value associated with the correlation coefficient is `p`, which determines the statistical significance of the observed relationship.\n- **Patterns:** A positive correlation suggests that areas with a higher percentage of Asian Indian ethnicity tend to have higher mean incomes, supporting the initial proposition.\n- **Outliers:** Identify any boroughs that deviate significantly from the trend, which could indicate unique socio-economic factors at play.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r):** Quantifies the linear relationship between the two variables.\n- **P-value:** Assesses the probability that the observed correlation is due to random chance.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Temporal Alignment:** The ethnicity data is from 2021, while the income data is from 2023. Assumptions about the stability of demographic distributions over time are necessary.\n- **Data Completeness:** Ensure that both datasets have complete and accurate records for all areas to avoid skewed results.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Scatter Plot:** Plot the percentage of Asian Indian ethnicity on the x-axis and mean income on the y-axis. Each point represents a borough, labeled for clarity.\n- **Trend Line:** Include a trend line to highlight the overall direction of the relationship.\n- **Highlight Outliers:** Use different colors or markers to identify outliers.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Temporal Discrepancy:** The two-year gap between datasets assumes no significant demographic shifts.\n- **Causation vs. Correlation:** The analysis identifies correlation, not causation. Other factors may influence income levels.\n- **Data Granularity:** Analysis at the LSOA level may not capture intra-borough variations.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"scatter\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"x\": \"ethnicity_value\",\n      \"y\": \"income_value\",\n      \"borough\": \"area_name\",\n      \"dataset1\": \"ethnicity\",\n      \"dataset2\": \"income\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis comprehensive analysis provides a clear understanding of the relationship between Asian Indian ethnicity and mean income in London boroughs, offering insights for policymakers and urban planners.",
