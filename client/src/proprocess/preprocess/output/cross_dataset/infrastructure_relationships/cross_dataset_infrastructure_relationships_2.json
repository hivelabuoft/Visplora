  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Preparation:**\n   - Extract income data for each London borough from 2019 to 2023 using the provided SQL query.\n   - Extract house price data for each borough for the year 2023 using the second SQL query.\n   - Ensure both datasets are cleaned and standardized, particularly focusing on consistent naming conventions for boroughs to facilitate accurate joining.\n\n2. **Data Integration:**\n   - Perform an inner join on the two datasets using the 'Area' field from the income dataset and 'area' from the house prices dataset.\n   - Align the datasets temporally by considering the lag relationship, where income growth over the period 2019-2023 is expected to influence house prices in 2023.\n\n3. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Calculate the percentage change in mean income for each borough from 2019 to 2023.\n   - Compare this percentage change with the house prices in 2023.\n   - Use Pearson correlation coefficient to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship between income growth and house prices.\n\n4. **Pattern Identification:**\n   - Identify boroughs with significant deviations from the average trend, highlighting potential outliers or areas with unique economic conditions.\n   - Use scatter plots to visually inspect the relationship and line charts to show trends over time.\n\n5. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Conduct hypothesis testing (e.g., t-test) to determine if the observed correlation is statistically significant.\n   - Set a significance level (e.g., p < 0.05) to validate the findings.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Coefficient:** The analysis may reveal a positive correlation between income growth and house prices, indicating that boroughs with higher income growth tend to have higher house prices in 2023.\n- **Outliers:** Certain boroughs may show a significant increase in house prices despite moderate income growth, possibly due to other factors like infrastructure development or changes in demand.\n- **Temporal Lag:** The lag relationship is evident if income growth from previous years correlates with current house prices, supporting the proposition.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient:** Provides a numerical measure of the relationship strength.\n- **P-value:** Assesses the probability that the observed correlation occurred by chance. A p-value less than 0.05 indicates statistical significance.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Consistency:** Ensure that the datasets are consistently formatted and free of errors or missing values.\n- **Temporal Coverage:** Verify that the income dataset covers the entire period from 2019 to 2023 without gaps.\n- **Geographical Accuracy:** Confirm that all boroughs are correctly matched between datasets.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Line Chart:** Display income trends from 2019 to 2023 alongside 2023 house prices for each borough.\n- **Scatter Plot:** Illustrate the correlation between percentage income growth and house prices for a clear visual representation of the relationship.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Lag Assumption:** The analysis assumes a direct lag effect of income growth on house prices, which may not account for other influencing factors.\n- **External Factors:** Other variables, such as interest rates, government policies, and demographic shifts, are not considered in this analysis.\n- **Data Limitations:** The accuracy of findings is contingent on the quality and completeness of the datasets.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"line\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"time\": \"2019-2023\",\n      \"value1\": \"income_value\",\n      \"value2\": \"house-prices_value\",\n      \"area\": \"area_name\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis structured output will facilitate the creation of a line chart to visualize the relationship between income growth and house prices across different boroughs over time.",
