  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**\n   - Extract population data for each London borough from the 2021 dataset.\n   - Extract private rent prices for each borough from the 2023 dataset.\n   - Ensure both datasets are aligned by the common key, which is the borough name.\n\n2. **Data Integration:**\n   - Perform an inner join on the two datasets using the borough name as the key to create a unified dataset that includes both population density and private rent prices.\n\n3. **Temporal Alignment:**\n   - Acknowledge the lag relationship by considering the population data from 2021 and rent prices from 2023. This temporal gap is crucial for understanding the potential impact of population density on rent prices over time.\n\n4. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the strength and direction of the relationship between population density and private rent prices.\n   - Use scatter plot visualization to visually assess the relationship and identify any patterns or outliers.\n\n5. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Conduct hypothesis testing to determine the statistical significance of the correlation.\n   - Use p-values to assess whether the observed correlation could have occurred by chance.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Coefficient:**\n  - The Pearson correlation coefficient will indicate the strength of the relationship. A value close to +1 or -1 suggests a strong relationship, while a value near 0 suggests a weak relationship.\n\n- **Patterns:**\n  - Identify any clusters or trends in the scatter plot that suggest a consistent relationship between higher population density and higher rent prices.\n\n- **Outliers:**\n  - Highlight any boroughs that deviate significantly from the trend, which may warrant further investigation.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **P-value:**\n  - Calculate the p-value to determine the likelihood that the observed correlation is due to random chance. A p-value less than 0.05 typically indicates statistical significance.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Data Completeness:**\n  - Ensure that both datasets are complete and cover all boroughs uniformly to avoid skewed results.\n\n- **Data Accuracy:**\n  - Verify the accuracy of data entries, especially for outliers, to ensure they are not due to data entry errors.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Scatter Plot:**\n  - Create a scatter plot with population density on the x-axis and private rent prices on the y-axis.\n  - Label each point with the borough name for easy identification.\n  - Use different colors or markers to highlight significant outliers or clusters.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Assumptions:**\n  - Assume that the datasets are representative of the actual population density and rent prices.\n  - Assume that other factors influencing rent prices (e.g., economic conditions, housing policies) are constant or negligible.\n\n- **Limitations:**\n  - The analysis only considers population density and rent prices, potentially overlooking other influential factors.\n  - The temporal lag assumes a direct influence of 2021 population density on 2023 rent prices, which may not capture all dynamics.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"scatter\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"x\": \"population_value\",\n      \"y\": \"private-rent_value\",\n      \"borough\": \"area_name\",\n      \"dataset1\": \"population\",\n      \"dataset2\": \"private-rent\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis structured output will facilitate the visualization of the relationship between population density and private rent prices across London boroughs, providing actionable insights into urban planning and housing policy considerations.",
