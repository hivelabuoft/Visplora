  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**\n   - Extract income data for 2023 using the query:\n     ```sql\n     SELECT area AS Area, mean_income AS Mean_income, year AS Year FROM income_data WHERE year = 2023\n     ```\n   - Extract library data for 2022-2023 using the query:\n     ```sql\n     SELECT area AS area, library_count AS value, category FROM library_data WHERE date BETWEEN 2022 AND 2023\n     ```\n   - Ensure both datasets have consistent area naming conventions for accurate joining.\n\n2. **Data Joining:**\n   - Perform an inner join on the datasets using the `Area` field to align income data with library data by borough.\n\n3. **Data Transformation:**\n   - Calculate libraries per capita by dividing `library_count` by the population of each borough if population data is available. If not, use `library_count` directly as a proxy.\n   - Ensure temporal alignment by considering that library data spans 2022-2023, which should be representative of the library infrastructure during the income measurement period.\n\n4. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Use Pearson correlation to measure the linear relationship between mean income and libraries per capita.\n   - Calculate the correlation coefficient (r) and the p-value to assess statistical significance.\n\n5. **Visualization:**\n   - Create a scatter plot with mean income on the x-axis and libraries per capita on the y-axis. Each point represents a borough.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Coefficient:** Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient to determine the strength and direction of the relationship.\n- **Statistical Significance:** Use the p-value to determine if the observed correlation is statistically significant (typically p < 0.05).\n- **Pattern Identification:** Identify any clusters or outliers in the scatter plot that suggest unique borough characteristics or anomalies.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r):** Indicates the strength and direction of the linear relationship.\n- **P-value:** Assesses the probability that the observed correlation occurred by chance.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Consistency:** Ensure area names are consistent across datasets.\n- **Completeness:** Verify that all boroughs are represented in both datasets.\n- **Accuracy:** Confirm that the library count data accurately reflects the number of libraries during the specified period.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Scatter Plot:** Plot mean income against libraries per capita, with each point labeled by borough name.\n- **Trend Line:** Add a trend line to visualize the overall direction of the relationship.\n- **Annotations:** Highlight significant outliers or clusters with annotations.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Temporal Alignment:** Assume that library data from 2022-2023 is representative of the infrastructure during the income measurement period.\n- **Population Data:** If libraries per capita is used, ensure population data is accurate and up-to-date.\n- **Causality:** Correlation does not imply causation; further analysis is needed to explore causal relationships.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"scatter\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"x\": \"income_value\",\n      \"y\": \"libraries_value\",\n      \"borough\": \"area_name\",\n      \"dataset1\": \"income\",\n      \"dataset2\": \"libraries\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between mean income and library availability in London boroughs, offering insights for urban planning and resource allocation.",
