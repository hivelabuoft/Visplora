  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**\n   - **Crime Data:** Extract crime data for each borough from 2022 to 2023 using the provided query. Aggregate the crime counts by borough to get a total crime rate per borough.\n   - **School Performance Data:** Extract school performance data for each area from 2021 to 2023 using the provided query. Calculate the average performance score for each borough.\n\n2. **Data Alignment:**\n   - Align the datasets by matching the `borough_name` from the crime dataset with the `area` from the school performance dataset. Ensure temporal alignment by focusing on the overlapping time frames (2022-2023 for crime and 2021-2023 for school performance).\n\n3. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Use Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the linear correlation between crime rates and school performance scores across boroughs. This will help quantify the strength and direction of the relationship.\n\n4. **Visualization:**\n   - Create a scatter plot with crime rates on the x-axis and school performance scores on the y-axis. Each point represents a borough, allowing for visual identification of trends, clusters, and outliers.\n\n5. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Perform hypothesis testing to determine the statistical significance of the observed correlation. Use a p-value threshold (e.g., p < 0.05) to assess significance.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Coefficient:** Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient. A negative value would support the proposition that higher crime rates are associated with lower school performance.\n- **Significant Patterns:** Identify any boroughs that deviate significantly from the trend, indicating potential outliers or unique cases.\n- **General Trend:** Discuss whether the data supports the proposition, indicating a negative correlation between crime rates and school performance.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **P-Value:** Report the p-value from the correlation analysis to assess the likelihood that the observed correlation occurred by chance.\n- **Confidence Intervals:** Provide confidence intervals for the correlation coefficient to understand the range within which the true correlation likely falls.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Data Completeness:** Ensure that both datasets have comprehensive coverage of all boroughs and relevant time periods.\n- **Data Consistency:** Verify that the data formats and definitions are consistent across datasets to ensure accurate alignment and analysis.\n- **Outliers and Anomalies:** Identify and address any outliers or anomalies that may skew the analysis.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Scatter Plot:** Use a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between crime rates and school performance. Include a trend line to highlight the overall direction of the relationship.\n- **Color Coding:** Differentiate boroughs using color coding or markers to enhance interpretability and highlight specific areas of interest.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Temporal Lag:** The analysis assumes that school performance in 2021-2023 is influenced by crime rates in 2022-2023, which may not fully capture causality due to potential temporal lags.\n- **Causality:** Correlation does not imply causation. Other factors may influence both crime rates and school performance, such as socioeconomic status or funding levels.\n- **Data Granularity:** The analysis is limited by the granularity of the data, which may not capture intra-borough variations or specific crime types impacting school performance.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"scatter\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"x\": \"crime-rates_value\",\n      \"y\": \"schools-colleges_value\",\n      \"borough\": \"area_name\",\n      \"dataset1\": \"crime-rates\",\n      \"dataset2\": \"schools-colleges\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis structure will facilitate visualization and further exploration of the relationship between crime rates and school performance across London boroughs.",
