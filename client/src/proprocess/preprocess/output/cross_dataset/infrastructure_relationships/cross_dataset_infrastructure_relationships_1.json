  "analysis": "## Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n### Step 1: Data Preparation\n- **Crime Data (2022-2023):** Aggregate the crime data to get total crime counts per borough. This involves summing the `count` for each `borough_name`.\n- **Gym Data (2024):** Filter the gym data to include only boutique gyms. Aggregate the gym count per borough to get the total number of boutique gyms per borough.\n\n### Step 2: Data Alignment\n- **Temporal Alignment:** Although the datasets are from different years, the analysis assumes that crime rates from 2022-2023 might influence the number of boutique gyms in 2024. This assumption is based on the idea that crime rates could impact business decisions, including the establishment of boutique gyms.\n\n### Step 3: Data Integration\n- **Joining Datasets:** Match the boroughs from the crime dataset with the corresponding areas in the gym dataset. This requires ensuring that the naming conventions for boroughs/areas are consistent across datasets.\n\n### Step 4: Correlation Analysis\n- **Correlation Calculation:** Use Pearson correlation to assess the relationship between crime rates and the number of boutique gyms per capita. Calculate the per capita values using population data if available.\n- **Scatter Plot Visualization:** Create a scatter plot with crime rates on the x-axis and the number of boutique gyms per capita on the y-axis.\n\n### Step 5: Statistical Validation\n- **Significance Testing:** Perform a significance test (e.g., t-test) to determine if the observed correlation is statistically significant.\n- **Outlier Detection:** Identify any boroughs that significantly deviate from the trend.\n\n## Key Findings and Correlations\n- **Correlation Coefficient:** The Pearson correlation coefficient will indicate the strength and direction of the relationship. A negative coefficient would support the proposition that higher crime rates correlate with fewer boutique gyms per capita.\n- **Significant Patterns:** If a significant negative correlation is found, it suggests that boroughs with higher crime rates tend to have fewer boutique gyms per capita.\n\n## Statistical Significance Measures\n- **P-Value:** A p-value less than 0.05 would indicate that the correlation is statistically significant.\n- **Confidence Interval:** Calculate a confidence interval for the correlation coefficient to understand the range of plausible values.\n\n## Data Quality Considerations\n- **Data Completeness:** Ensure that both datasets cover all boroughs and have no missing values.\n- **Data Consistency:** Verify that the naming conventions and measurement units are consistent across datasets.\n\n## Visualization Recommendations\n- **Scatter Plot:** Use a scatter plot to visualize the correlation, with boroughs labeled for easy identification of outliers.\n- **Trend Line:** Include a trend line to highlight the overall relationship.\n\n## Limitations and Assumptions\n- **Temporal Assumption:** The analysis assumes that crime rates from 2022-2023 could influence gym establishment decisions in 2024, which may not account for other factors affecting gym distribution.\n- **Population Data:** The analysis assumes availability of population data for calculating per capita values. If unavailable, the analysis may be limited to raw counts.\n- **External Factors:** Other factors, such as economic conditions or local policies, may also influence the number of boutique gyms and are not accounted for in this analysis.\n\n## Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"scatter\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"x\": \"crime-rates_value\",\n      \"y\": \"gyms_value\",\n      \"borough\": \"area_name\",\n      \"dataset1\": \"crime-rates\",\n      \"dataset2\": \"gyms\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis structure will be used to generate the scatter plot, with each point representing a borough, allowing for visual inspection of the relationship between crime rates and boutique gyms per capita.",
