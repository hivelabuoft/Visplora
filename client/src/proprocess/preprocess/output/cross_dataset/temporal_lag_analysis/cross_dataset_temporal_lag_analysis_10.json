  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**\n   - Extract data from the `schools-colleges` dataset for the years 2022-2023, focusing on performance scores by borough.\n   - Extract data from the `house-prices` dataset for the year 2024, focusing on house prices by borough.\n   - Ensure both datasets are cleaned and standardized, particularly in terms of borough names to facilitate accurate joining.\n\n2. **Temporal Alignment:**\n   - Given the lag relationship, align the school performance data from 2022-2023 with the house prices data from 2024. This allows us to explore the potential impact of school performance on subsequent house prices.\n\n3. **Data Joining:**\n   - Perform an inner join on the two datasets using the `area` (borough) as the key. This will create a combined dataset where each entry contains both the school performance score and the corresponding house price for a borough.\n\n4. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship between school performance scores and house prices.\n   - Conduct a regression analysis to further explore the relationship and predict house prices based on school performance scores.\n\n5. **Outlier Detection:**\n   - Identify any boroughs that significantly deviate from the general trend using statistical methods such as Z-score analysis.\n\n6. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Use hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests) to determine the statistical significance of the observed correlation.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Coefficient:** A positive Pearson correlation coefficient (e.g., 0.65) would suggest a moderate to strong positive relationship between school performance and house prices.\n- **Regression Analysis:** A significant regression model (p-value < 0.05) would indicate that school performance is a predictor of house prices.\n- **Outliers:** Boroughs with exceptionally high or low house prices relative to their school performance scores should be examined for unique factors influencing these deviations.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient:** Quantifies the linear relationship between the two variables.\n- **P-Value:** Assesses the probability that the observed correlation is due to chance. A p-value less than 0.05 typically indicates statistical significance.\n- **Confidence Intervals:** Provide a range within which the true correlation coefficient is likely to fall.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Data Completeness:** Ensure all boroughs have complete data for both school performance and house prices.\n- **Data Consistency:** Verify that performance scores and house prices are measured consistently across boroughs.\n- **Temporal Accuracy:** Confirm that the temporal alignment accurately reflects the lag relationship.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Scatter Plot:** Plot school performance scores on the x-axis and house prices on the y-axis. Each point represents a borough.\n- **Trend Line:** Include a regression line to visualize the overall trend.\n- **Color Coding:** Use different colors or symbols to distinguish between different categories of schools (e.g., primary, secondary).\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Causality vs. Correlation:** The analysis identifies correlation, not causation. Other factors may influence house prices.\n- **Data Limitations:** The analysis assumes the datasets are comprehensive and accurately reflect the variables of interest.\n- **External Factors:** Consideration of external factors such as economic conditions, policy changes, and demographic shifts that might also impact house prices.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"scatter\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"x\": \"schools-colleges_value\",\n      \"y\": \"house-prices_value\",\n      \"borough\": \"area_name\",\n      \"dataset1\": \"schools-colleges\",\n      \"dataset2\": \"house-prices\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis analysis provides a structured approach to understanding the relationship between school performance and house prices across London boroughs, offering insights that can inform policy and investment decisions.",
