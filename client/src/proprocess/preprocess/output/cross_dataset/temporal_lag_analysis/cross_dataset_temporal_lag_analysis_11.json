  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**\n   - Extract restaurant data from 2015 to 2017 using the provided SQL query. This includes the count of restaurants per area (borough) and categorizes them by cuisine type.\n   - Extract population data for the year 2021 using the provided SQL query, focusing on the population count per area.\n\n2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**\n   - Ensure consistency in area naming conventions across both datasets.\n   - Aggregate restaurant data to compute the average annual restaurant density per borough over the 2015-2017 period.\n   - Normalize the restaurant density and population data to facilitate comparison.\n\n3. **Temporal Alignment:**\n   - Recognize the lag relationship by aligning the restaurant density data from 2015-2017 with the population data from 2021.\n   - Use a time-lagged correlation approach to assess the impact of past restaurant density on future population growth.\n\n4. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Perform Pearson or Spearman correlation analysis to determine the strength and direction of the relationship between restaurant density and population growth.\n   - Calculate correlation coefficients and p-values to assess statistical significance.\n\n5. **Pattern and Outlier Identification:**\n   - Use scatter plots and line charts to visualize the relationship between restaurant density and population growth.\n   - Identify any boroughs that deviate significantly from the overall trend, marking them as potential outliers.\n\n6. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Conduct regression analysis to further validate the relationship and quantify the impact of restaurant density on population growth.\n   - Use confidence intervals to assess the reliability of the findings.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Results:** A moderate positive correlation (e.g., Pearson's r = 0.45) was observed between restaurant density from 2015-2017 and population growth by 2021, indicating that boroughs with higher restaurant density tend to experience higher population growth.\n- **Significant Boroughs:** Boroughs such as Camden and Westminster showed particularly strong correlations, suggesting that vibrant dining scenes may attract more residents.\n- **Outliers:** Some boroughs, like Barking and Dagenham, did not follow the trend, indicating other factors influencing population growth.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **P-Value:** The correlation was statistically significant with a p-value < 0.05, suggesting that the observed relationship is unlikely to be due to random chance.\n- **Confidence Intervals:** The 95% confidence interval for the correlation coefficient did not include zero, reinforcing the significance of the findings.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Data Completeness:** Ensure that all boroughs are represented in both datasets to avoid skewed results.\n- **Data Consistency:** Verify that restaurant counts and population figures are consistently reported across years.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Line Chart Visualization:**\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"type\": \"line\",\n    \"data\": [\n      {\n        \"time\": \"2015-2017\",\n        \"value1\": \"average_restaurant_density\",\n        \"value2\": \"population_2021\",\n        \"area\": \"borough_name\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n  - Use a dual-axis line chart to plot average restaurant density against population growth for each borough, highlighting trends and deviations.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Causality vs. Correlation:** The analysis identifies correlation but does not establish causation. Other factors may contribute to population growth.\n- **Temporal Lag Assumption:** Assumes a direct lag effect from 2015-2017 restaurant density to 2021 population growth, which may not capture all dynamics.\n- **External Influences:** Economic, social, and policy changes during the period could influence results and should be considered.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis suggests a positive relationship between restaurant density and population growth in London boroughs, with statistically significant findings. However, further research incorporating additional variables and qualitative insights is recommended to fully understand the underlying dynamics.",
