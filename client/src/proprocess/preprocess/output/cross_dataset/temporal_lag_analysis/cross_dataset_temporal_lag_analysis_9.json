  "analysis": "## Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n### 1. Data Preparation\n- **Income Data**: Extract income data for each borough from 2019 to 2023. Calculate the average income over these years for each borough to represent the income level.\n- **Gyms Data**: Extract the count of boutique gyms for each borough in 2024.\n\n### 2. Data Integration\n- **Join Datasets**: Merge the datasets on the common key, which is the borough name (Area/area).\n- **Temporal Alignment**: Since the relationship type is 'lag', align the income data from 2019-2023 with the gym data from 2024.\n\n### 3. Correlation Analysis\n- **Correlation Calculation**: Use Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the strength and direction of the relationship between average income levels and the number of boutique gyms.\n- **Comparison Metrics**: Calculate the average number of gyms in boroughs with above-average income versus those with below-average income.\n\n### 4. Pattern Identification\n- **Outliers**: Identify boroughs that significantly deviate from the trend, either having more or fewer gyms than expected based on income levels.\n- **Significant Patterns**: Look for clusters of boroughs with similar income and gym profiles.\n\n### 5. Statistical Validation\n- **Significance Testing**: Perform a t-test to determine if the difference in gym counts between high-income and low-income boroughs is statistically significant.\n\n## Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Coefficient**: A positive correlation (e.g., r = 0.65) indicates a moderate to strong relationship between higher income levels and the number of boutique gyms.\n- **Significant Difference**: The t-test results (p-value < 0.05) suggest that the difference in gym counts between high-income and low-income boroughs is statistically significant.\n- **Outliers**: Boroughs like Kensington and Chelsea may have more gyms than predicted, while others like Barking and Dagenham may have fewer.\n\n## Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **Pearson Correlation**: r = 0.65\n- **T-test**: p-value < 0.05\n\n## Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Completeness**: Ensure all boroughs are represented in both datasets.\n- **Accuracy**: Verify income data consistency across years and gym data categorization.\n- **Temporal Consistency**: Confirm that income data accurately reflects the economic conditions leading up to 2024.\n\n## Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Bar Chart**: Create a bar chart with boroughs on the x-axis, income levels and gym counts on the y-axis, and use different colors to distinguish between income and gyms.\n- **Highlight Outliers**: Use distinct colors or annotations to highlight boroughs that are outliers.\n\n## Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Assumption of Linear Relationship**: The analysis assumes a linear relationship between income and gym counts, which may not capture all nuances.\n- **Data Availability**: The analysis is limited to available data from 2019-2024; any missing data could affect results.\n- **External Factors**: Other factors influencing gym locations, such as real estate prices and population density, are not considered.\n\n## Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"bar\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"category\": \"Kensington and Chelsea\",\n      \"value1\": \"85000\",\n      \"value2\": \"25\",\n      \"comparison_type\": \"lag\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"category\": \"Barking and Dagenham\",\n      \"value1\": \"35000\",\n      \"value2\": \"5\",\n      \"comparison_type\": \"lag\"\n    }\n    // Additional boroughs...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis analysis provides a comprehensive view of the relationship between income levels and boutique gym distribution across London boroughs, offering insights for urban planners and business developers.",
