  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**\n   - Extract private rent data for each borough from 2019 to 2023 using the provided SQL query.\n   - Extract library count data for each borough for the year 2024 using the provided SQL query.\n   - Ensure both datasets are cleaned and formatted consistently, focusing on borough names for accurate joining.\n\n2. **Data Joining:**\n   - Perform an inner join on the two datasets using the 'area' field to align boroughs between the private rent and library datasets.\n\n3. **Temporal Alignment:**\n   - Since the relationship type is lag, align the datasets by considering the rent increase from 2019-2023 and its potential impact on library counts in 2024.\n\n4. **Calculation of Rent Increase:**\n   - For each borough, calculate the percentage increase in private rent from 2019 to 2023.\n\n5. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Use Pearson correlation coefficient to assess the relationship between the percentage increase in private rent and the number of libraries in 2024.\n\n6. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Conduct hypothesis testing to determine the statistical significance of the correlation. Use a significance level (alpha) of 0.05.\n\n7. **Pattern and Outlier Identification:**\n   - Identify any boroughs that significantly deviate from the trend, either with unusually high or low library counts relative to rent increases.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Coefficient:** Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient to quantify the relationship between rent increases and library counts.\n- **Significant Patterns:** Identify any positive or negative correlation trends. For example, a positive correlation would suggest that boroughs with higher rent increases tend to have more libraries by 2024.\n- **Outliers:** Highlight any boroughs that do not follow the general trend, which could indicate unique local factors affecting library availability.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **P-Value:** Calculate the p-value from the correlation analysis to determine if the observed correlation is statistically significant.\n- **Confidence Interval:** Provide a confidence interval for the correlation coefficient to understand the range of possible correlation values.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Consistency:** Ensure that borough names are consistent across datasets to avoid mismatches during the join process.\n- **Completeness:** Verify that all boroughs are represented in both datasets to ensure comprehensive analysis.\n- **Accuracy:** Check for any anomalies or errors in the data that could skew results, such as incorrect rent values or library counts.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Dual Axis Chart:** Create a dual-axis chart where one axis represents the percentage increase in private rent (2019-2023) and the other represents the number of libraries in 2024.\n- **Data Points:** Plot each borough as a data point to visualize the relationship and identify trends or outliers.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Causality vs. Correlation:** The analysis identifies correlation, not causation. Other factors may influence library counts beyond rent increases.\n- **Temporal Lag:** Assumes a lag effect where rent changes impact library counts, which may not capture immediate or long-term effects accurately.\n- **External Factors:** Does not account for external influences such as government policies, funding changes, or demographic shifts that could affect library availability.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"dual_axis\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"area\": \"Borough A\",\n      \"primary_value\": 15.0,  // Example rent increase percentage\n      \"secondary_value\": 10,  // Example library count\n      \"time\": \"2019-2024\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"area\": \"Borough B\",\n      \"primary_value\": 20.0,\n      \"secondary_value\": 8,\n      \"time\": \"2019-2024\"\n    }\n    // Additional borough data points...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis structured approach provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between private rent increases and library availability in London boroughs, offering insights into urban dynamics and resource allocation.",
