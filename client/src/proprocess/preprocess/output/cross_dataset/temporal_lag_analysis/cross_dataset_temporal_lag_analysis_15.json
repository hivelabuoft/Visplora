  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**\n   - Extract income data for each London borough from 1999 to 2023.\n   - Extract private rent prices for each borough for the year 2024.\n   - Ensure both datasets are aligned by borough names to facilitate merging.\n\n2. **Temporal Alignment:**\n   - Since the relationship type is \"lag,\" the analysis will focus on how historical income data (1999-2023) correlates with future rent prices (2024).\n   - Calculate the mean income for each borough over the period 1999-2023 to represent historical income levels.\n\n3. **Data Merging:**\n   - Merge the datasets on the 'Area' field to align income data with rent prices for each borough.\n   - Ensure data consistency by checking for missing or mismatched borough names.\n\n4. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between the mean income (1999-2023) and the private rent prices (2024) for each borough.\n   - Use this coefficient to assess the strength and direction of the relationship.\n\n5. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Conduct hypothesis testing to determine the statistical significance of the correlation.\n   - Use a significance level (typically 0.05) to validate the findings.\n\n6. **Pattern and Outlier Identification:**\n   - Identify boroughs that deviate significantly from the trend, either with high income but low rent or vice versa.\n   - Analyze potential reasons for these outliers, such as local policies or unique economic factors.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Coefficient:** A positive correlation coefficient indicates that boroughs with higher historical mean incomes tend to have higher private rent prices in 2024.\n- **Significant Patterns:** Boroughs like Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster, and Camden may show strong positive correlations due to their high-income levels and desirability.\n- **Outliers:** Boroughs with high income but relatively lower rent prices may be due to factors like housing supply, rent control policies, or recent economic changes.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r):** Measures the linear relationship between income and rent prices.\n- **p-value:** Determines the probability that the observed correlation occurred by chance. A p-value less than 0.05 indicates statistical significance.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Consistency:** Ensure borough names are consistent across datasets.\n- **Completeness:** Address any missing data points, especially in income records over the years.\n- **Accuracy:** Validate data sources and methodologies used in data collection.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Bar Chart:** Use a grouped bar chart to compare mean income and rent prices for each borough.\n- **Axes:** The x-axis should represent boroughs, while the y-axis should show values for both income and rent.\n- **Color Coding:** Different colors for income and rent bars to distinguish between the two variables.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Temporal Lag Assumption:** Assumes that historical income directly influences future rent prices, which may not account for rapid economic changes or policy shifts.\n- **Data Limitations:** Potential inaccuracies in historical income data or rent price projections could affect results.\n- **External Factors:** Other factors such as government policies, housing supply, and economic conditions are not accounted for in this analysis.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"bar\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"category\": \"Kensington and Chelsea\",\n      \"value1\": 75000,\n      \"value2\": 2500,\n      \"comparison_type\": \"lag\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"category\": \"Westminster\",\n      \"value1\": 72000,\n      \"value2\": 2400,\n      \"comparison_type\": \"lag\"\n    },\n    // Additional boroughs...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis analysis provides a comprehensive view of the relationship between historical income levels and future rent prices across London boroughs, offering insights for policymakers, real estate investors, and urban planners.",
