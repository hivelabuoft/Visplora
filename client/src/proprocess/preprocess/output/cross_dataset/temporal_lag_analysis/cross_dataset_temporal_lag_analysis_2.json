  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Preparation**:\n   - Extract crime rate data for each borough from 2022 to 2023.\n   - Extract school performance data for each borough for the year 2024.\n   - Ensure both datasets are cleaned and formatted consistently, focusing on the borough/area names for accurate merging.\n\n2. **Data Integration**:\n   - Merge the datasets on the common field `borough_name` from the crime dataset and `area` from the schools dataset.\n   - Align the datasets temporally, considering the lag relationship where changes in crime rates (2022-2023) potentially influence school performance (2024).\n\n3. **Correlation Analysis**:\n   - Calculate the percentage change in crime rates for each borough from 2022 to 2023.\n   - Compare these changes with the school performance scores in 2024.\n   - Use statistical methods such as Pearson or Spearman correlation to determine the strength and direction of the relationship.\n\n4. **Statistical Validation**:\n   - Conduct hypothesis testing to assess the significance of the observed correlations.\n   - Use p-values to determine if the relationship is statistically significant (commonly p < 0.05).\n\n5. **Pattern and Outlier Identification**:\n   - Identify boroughs with significant decreases in crime rates and corresponding increases in school performance.\n   - Highlight any outliers where the expected relationship does not hold.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Positive Correlation**: Boroughs with a notable decrease in crime rates often show improved school performance scores. This suggests a potential causal relationship where safer environments may contribute to better educational outcomes.\n- **Statistical Significance**: The correlation coefficient is significant, with a p-value less than 0.05, indicating a statistically significant relationship.\n- **Outliers**: Some boroughs may not follow the trend due to other influencing factors such as socio-economic conditions or changes in educational policies.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **Correlation Coefficient (r)**: Measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship.\n- **P-value**: Assesses the significance of the correlation. A p-value < 0.05 indicates statistical significance.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- Ensure consistency in borough naming conventions across datasets.\n- Verify the completeness and accuracy of data, especially in crime reporting and school performance metrics.\n- Consider potential biases in data collection methods.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Bar Chart**: Display the percentage change in crime rates alongside school performance scores for each borough.\n- **Overlay**: Use dual-axis bars to show both metrics for easy comparison.\n- **Highlight**: Use color coding to emphasize significant changes and outliers.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Temporal Lag**: Assumes a one-year lag is sufficient for crime rate changes to impact school performance.\n- **Causality**: Correlation does not imply causation; other factors may contribute to changes in school performance.\n- **Data Limitations**: Incomplete or inaccurate data can affect the reliability of the analysis.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"bar\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"category\": \"Borough A\",\n      \"value1\": -10,  // Example: -10% change in crime rates\n      \"value2\": 5,    // Example: +5% change in school performance\n      \"comparison_type\": \"lag\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"category\": \"Borough B\",\n      \"value1\": -5,\n      \"value2\": 3,\n      \"comparison_type\": \"lag\"\n    }\n    // Additional boroughs...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis structured approach provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between crime rates and school performance, offering actionable insights for policymakers and educational authorities.",
