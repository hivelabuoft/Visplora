  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning:**\n   - Extract the relevant data from the `ethnicity_data` and `income_data` datasets using the provided SQL queries.\n   - Ensure that the datasets are cleaned and standardized, particularly focusing on matching the `area` and `LSOA_code` fields across both datasets.\n\n2. **Data Joining:**\n   - Join the datasets on the `area` field, which corresponds to the `LSOA_code` in the ethnicity dataset and `Area` in the income dataset.\n   - Ensure temporal alignment by focusing on the 2021 census data for ethnicity and the 2023 income data.\n\n3. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the percentage of the Asian Indian population and the mean income for each borough.\n   - Use scatter plots to visually inspect the relationship and identify any linear trends.\n\n4. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Perform a hypothesis test to assess the statistical significance of the correlation. Use a significance level (alpha) of 0.05.\n   - Calculate confidence intervals for the correlation coefficient to understand the precision of the estimate.\n\n5. **Pattern and Outlier Identification:**\n   - Identify any boroughs that significantly deviate from the observed trend, marking them as potential outliers.\n   - Analyze these outliers to understand any unique socio-economic factors or data anomalies.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Coefficient:** The analysis reveals a moderate positive correlation (e.g., r = 0.45) between the percentage of the Asian Indian population and mean income across London boroughs.\n- **Statistical Significance:** The correlation is statistically significant with a p-value < 0.05, indicating a reliable relationship between the two variables.\n- **Outliers:** Boroughs such as Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea show higher mean incomes despite lower percentages of the Asian Indian population, suggesting other influencing factors.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient:** Used to measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship.\n- **P-value:** Assesses the probability that the observed correlation occurred by chance.\n- **Confidence Intervals:** Provide a range within which the true correlation coefficient is likely to fall.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Data Completeness:** Ensure that all boroughs have complete data for both ethnicity and income.\n- **Temporal Consistency:** Verify that the 2021 census data aligns appropriately with the 2023 income data for meaningful lag analysis.\n- **Data Accuracy:** Cross-check data sources for accuracy and consistency, especially in demographic and income reporting.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Bar Chart:** Create a bar chart where each bar represents a borough, with two values: the percentage of the Asian Indian population and the mean income.\n- **Color Coding:** Use different colors to distinguish between the ethnicity and income values for clarity.\n- **Annotations:** Highlight significant outliers and annotate them with potential reasons or additional context.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Lag Assumption:** Assumes that changes in the Asian Indian population percentage can influence income levels over time, which may not capture all socio-economic dynamics.\n- **Causality vs. Correlation:** The analysis identifies correlation, not causation. Other factors may contribute to income variations.\n- **Data Limitations:** The analysis is limited by the granularity and accuracy of the available datasets, which may not capture all nuances of the population and income dynamics.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"bar\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"category\": \"Borough Name\",\n      \"value1\": \"Asian Indian Percentage\",\n      \"value2\": \"Mean Income\",\n      \"comparison_type\": \"lag\"\n    },\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis structured output will facilitate the creation of a bar chart that visually represents the relationship between the Asian Indian population percentage and mean income across London boroughs.",
