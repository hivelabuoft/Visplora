  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**\n   - Extract income data for London boroughs for the year 2023 using the provided SQL query.\n   - Extract house price data for London boroughs from 1995 to the present using the provided SQL query.\n   - Ensure both datasets are cleaned and standardized, focusing on consistent naming conventions for boroughs.\n\n2. **Data Integration:**\n   - Join the two datasets on the 'Area' field, ensuring that each borough's mean income is matched with its corresponding house price data.\n   - Aggregate house prices over the period from 1995 to the present to obtain a representative value (e.g., mean or median) for each borough.\n\n3. **Temporal Alignment:**\n   - Since the relationship type is a proxy, align the datasets by using the 2023 income data and the aggregated house price data from 1995-present.\n   - This approach assumes that historical house prices can be indicative of current income levels.\n\n4. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between mean income and mean/median house prices for each borough to assess the strength and direction of the relationship.\n   - Identify any significant patterns or outliers that may suggest deviations from the general trend.\n\n5. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Perform hypothesis testing to determine the statistical significance of the observed correlation.\n   - Use p-values to assess the likelihood that the observed correlation is due to chance.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Results:**\n  - A positive correlation is expected between mean income in 2023 and historical house prices, indicating that boroughs with higher income levels tend to have higher house prices over the period analyzed.\n  - The strength of the correlation will be quantified by the Pearson correlation coefficient.\n\n- **Significant Patterns:**\n  - Boroughs with exceptionally high or low income levels relative to their house prices will be identified as outliers.\n  - These outliers may indicate unique local factors affecting income or housing markets.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient:** Quantifies the linear relationship between income and house prices.\n- **P-value:** Assesses the statistical significance of the correlation, with a threshold (e.g., p < 0.05) indicating a significant relationship.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Consistency:** Ensure that borough names are consistent across datasets to avoid mismatches.\n- **Completeness:** Verify that all relevant boroughs are included in both datasets.\n- **Accuracy:** Check for any anomalies or errors in the data that could skew results.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Scatter Plot:**\n  - Plot mean income (x-axis) against mean/median house prices (y-axis) for each borough.\n  - Highlight outliers and provide a trend line to visualize the correlation.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Temporal Assumption:** The analysis assumes that historical house prices are a valid proxy for current income levels, which may not account for recent economic changes.\n- **Data Limitations:** The analysis is limited by the availability and accuracy of the datasets, particularly if there are gaps in the data.\n- **External Factors:** The analysis does not account for external factors such as government policies, economic shifts, or demographic changes that could influence income or house prices.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis analysis provides insights into the relationship between income levels and house prices across London boroughs, highlighting areas with significant deviations from the trend. The findings can inform urban planning and policy decisions, particularly in addressing housing affordability and economic disparities.",
