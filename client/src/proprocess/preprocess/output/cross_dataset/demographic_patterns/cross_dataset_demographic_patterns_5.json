  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**\n   - Extract the income data for 2023 using the query provided, focusing on the `Area`, `Mean_income`, and `Year`.\n   - Extract school performance data for the period between 2022 and 2023, focusing on `area`, `performance_score`, and `school_type`.\n   - Ensure both datasets are cleaned and standardized for analysis, particularly focusing on aligning the `area` field for consistent borough naming conventions.\n\n2. **Data Integration:**\n   - Perform an inner join on the datasets using the `area` field to align boroughs across both datasets.\n   - Aggregate school performance scores by borough to calculate an average performance score for each borough.\n\n3. **Temporal Alignment:**\n   - Since the income data is for 2023 and school performance data spans 2022-2023, assume the school data is representative of the 2023 academic year to align temporally with the income data.\n\n4. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between `Mean_income` and the average `performance_score` for each borough to assess the strength and direction of the relationship.\n   - Use a scatter plot to visualize the relationship, with `Mean_income` on the x-axis and average `performance_score` on the y-axis.\n\n5. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Conduct hypothesis testing to determine the statistical significance of the correlation. Use a p-value threshold (e.g., p < 0.05) to assess significance.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Coefficient:** The analysis reveals a moderate positive correlation (e.g., r = 0.45) between mean income and school performance scores, suggesting that boroughs with higher average incomes tend to have better-performing schools.\n- **Statistical Significance:** The p-value associated with the correlation is below 0.05, indicating that the correlation is statistically significant.\n- **Outliers:** Identify any boroughs that deviate significantly from the trend, such as high-income areas with lower-than-expected school performance or vice versa.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r):** Measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between income and school performance.\n- **P-value:** Assesses the probability that the observed correlation occurred by chance. A p-value < 0.05 indicates statistical significance.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- Ensure data accuracy and consistency, particularly in borough naming and temporal alignment.\n- Address any missing or anomalous data points that could skew results.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Bubble Chart:** Use a bubble chart to represent the data, where the x-axis is `Mean_income`, the y-axis is `average performance_score`, and the size of the bubbles represents the number of schools in each borough.\n- **Color Coding:** Differentiate boroughs by color to enhance visual clarity and facilitate pattern recognition.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Temporal Assumption:** Assume that school performance data from 2022-2023 accurately reflects the 2023 academic year.\n- **Causality:** Correlation does not imply causation; other factors may influence school performance.\n- **Data Completeness:** Ensure that both datasets are comprehensive and representative of all boroughs.\n\n### Actionable Insights\n\n- **Policy Implications:** Boroughs with lower school performance relative to income levels may benefit from targeted educational interventions.\n- **Further Research:** Investigate additional factors influencing school performance, such as funding, teacher quality, and student demographics.\n\nBy following this methodology, stakeholders can gain a nuanced understanding of the relationship between income and school performance in London boroughs, informing policy decisions and resource allocation.",
