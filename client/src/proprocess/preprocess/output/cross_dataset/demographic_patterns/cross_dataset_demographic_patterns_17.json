  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**\n   - Extract private rent data from 2011 to present and house prices data from 1995 to present using the provided SQL queries.\n   - Ensure both datasets are cleaned and standardized, focusing on consistent area/borough names for accurate merging.\n\n2. **Temporal Alignment:**\n   - Since the proposition involves comparing rent prices from 2011-present with house prices from 1995-present, we need to aggregate house prices data to align with the rent data timeline.\n   - Calculate average house prices for each borough from 1995 to 2010 to establish a baseline for comparison with rent prices from 2011 onward.\n\n3. **Data Integration:**\n   - Merge the datasets on the 'area' field, ensuring each borough's rent prices are paired with the corresponding house prices.\n   - Align the datasets temporally by focusing on the period from 2011 onward for both datasets.\n\n4. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Use Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the strength and direction of the relationship between private rent prices and house prices.\n   - Conduct the analysis for each borough individually to identify local trends and variations.\n\n5. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Perform hypothesis testing to assess the statistical significance of the observed correlations.\n   - Use p-values to determine the likelihood that the observed correlation is due to chance.\n\n6. **Pattern and Outlier Identification:**\n   - Analyze the correlation results to identify significant patterns, such as consistently high correlations in specific boroughs.\n   - Detect outliers where the correlation deviates significantly from the norm.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Overall Correlation:** A moderate to strong positive correlation is expected between private rent prices and house prices, indicating that boroughs with higher rents tend to have higher house prices.\n- **Borough-Specific Trends:** Some boroughs may exhibit stronger correlations due to localized economic factors, such as proximity to business districts or transportation hubs.\n- **Temporal Trends:** The correlation may vary over time, with certain periods showing stronger relationships due to economic cycles or policy changes.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r):** Quantifies the degree of linear relationship between rent and house prices.\n- **P-Value:** Assesses the probability that the observed correlation is due to random chance. A p-value less than 0.05 typically indicates statistical significance.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Data Completeness:** Ensure that both datasets are complete and cover all boroughs consistently.\n- **Data Accuracy:** Verify that the data sources are reliable and that the data has been accurately recorded and reported.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Line Chart:** Plot a line chart with time on the x-axis and both private rent prices and house prices on the y-axis, using different colors for each dataset.\n- **Borough-Specific Charts:** Create separate line charts for each borough to visualize local trends and correlations.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Temporal Lag:** The analysis assumes that house prices from 1995-2010 can influence rent prices from 2011 onward, which may not fully capture dynamic market changes.\n- **External Factors:** The analysis does not account for other factors influencing prices, such as economic policies, interest rates, or demographic shifts.\n- **Data Granularity:** The analysis assumes that annual or quarterly data is sufficient to capture meaningful trends, which may overlook short-term fluctuations.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"line\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"time\": \"2011-2025\",\n      \"value1\": \"average_private_rent\",\n      \"value2\": \"average_house_price\",\n      \"area\": \"borough_name\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis analysis provides a comprehensive approach to understanding the relationship between private rent prices and house prices across London boroughs, offering insights into market dynamics and potential investment opportunities.",
