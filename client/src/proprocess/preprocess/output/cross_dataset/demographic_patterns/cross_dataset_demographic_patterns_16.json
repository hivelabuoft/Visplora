  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Preparation:**\n   - Extract income data for 2023 using the provided SQL query to obtain the mean income for each borough.\n   - Extract restaurant data for the period 2015-2017 using the provided SQL query to obtain the total number of restaurants per borough.\n\n2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:**\n   - Ensure that the area names are consistent across both datasets for accurate merging.\n   - Aggregate the restaurant data by borough to get the total restaurant count for each borough over the specified period.\n\n3. **Data Integration:**\n   - Perform an inner join on the two datasets using the 'Area' field to align the income data with the restaurant data by borough.\n\n4. **Temporal Alignment:**\n   - Recognize that the income data is from 2023, while the restaurant data spans 2015-2017. The assumption here is that restaurant presence in earlier years could influence or correlate with future income levels, serving as a proxy for economic activity and attractiveness of the area.\n\n5. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient to assess the strength and direction of the relationship between mean income and restaurant count.\n   - Use scatter plot visualization to visually inspect the relationship and identify any patterns or outliers.\n\n6. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Perform hypothesis testing to determine the statistical significance of the observed correlation, using a significance level (e.g., p-value < 0.05).\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Coefficient:** The Pearson correlation coefficient will quantify the relationship between mean income and restaurant count. A positive value suggests that higher income is associated with more restaurants, while a negative value suggests the opposite.\n- **Significant Patterns:** Look for clusters of boroughs with high income and high restaurant counts, as well as outliers that deviate from the general trend.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **P-value:** Calculate the p-value to test the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between income and restaurant count. A p-value less than 0.05 would indicate a statistically significant correlation.\n- **Confidence Interval:** Provide a confidence interval for the correlation coefficient to assess the reliability of the estimate.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Consistency:** Ensure that the area names are consistent across datasets.\n- **Completeness:** Verify that all boroughs are represented in both datasets.\n- **Accuracy:** Consider potential discrepancies in restaurant data due to changes in data collection methods or missing entries.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Scatter Plot:** Create a scatter plot with mean income on the x-axis and restaurant count on the y-axis. Each point represents a borough, labeled with the borough name.\n- **Trend Line:** Include a trend line to highlight the overall relationship and direction of the correlation.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Temporal Misalignment:** The analysis assumes that restaurant data from 2015-2017 can serve as a proxy for economic conditions influencing income in 2023.\n- **Causality:** The analysis identifies correlation, not causation. Other factors may influence both income and restaurant presence.\n- **Data Limitations:** The analysis is limited by the quality and completeness of the available data.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"scatter\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"x\": \"income_value\",\n      \"y\": \"restaurants_value\",\n      \"borough\": \"area_name\",\n      \"dataset1\": \"income\",\n      \"dataset2\": \"restaurants\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis analysis provides a comprehensive approach to understanding the relationship between income levels and restaurant presence across London boroughs, offering insights into economic and social dynamics.",
