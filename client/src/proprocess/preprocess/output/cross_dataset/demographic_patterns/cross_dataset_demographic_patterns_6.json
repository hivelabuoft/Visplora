  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning:**\n   - Extract the relevant data from the ethnicity and house price datasets using the provided SQL queries.\n   - Ensure that the data is cleaned and standardized, particularly focusing on consistent area names and formats.\n\n2. **Data Integration:**\n   - Join the datasets on the 'area' field, which represents the boroughs of London. This will allow us to align the ethnicity data with the house price data.\n   - Ensure temporal alignment by focusing on the house price data from 1995 to the present, while using the most recent ethnicity data from the 2021 census.\n\n3. **Temporal Analysis:**\n   - For each borough, analyze the trend of house prices over time and compare it with the percentage of Asian Indian ethnicity.\n   - Use a proxy relationship approach to infer potential influences of ethnicity on house price trends.\n\n4. **Correlation and Statistical Analysis:**\n   - Calculate correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson or Spearman) to measure the strength of the relationship between the percentage of Asian Indian ethnicity and house price trends.\n   - Identify patterns or outliers by comparing the house price trends of boroughs with high Asian Indian percentages against those with lower percentages.\n\n5. **Visualization:**\n   - Create a line chart for each borough to visualize the house price trends over time, with an overlay of the Asian Indian percentage for context.\n   - Highlight significant deviations or patterns in the line chart.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Analysis:**\n  - Boroughs with a high percentage of Asian Indian ethnicity may show distinct house price trends compared to those with lower percentages. This could manifest as either more rapid increases, stability, or unique fluctuations in house prices.\n  - The correlation coefficient will indicate the strength and direction of this relationship, helping to identify whether a significant correlation exists.\n\n- **Pattern Identification:**\n  - Look for consistent patterns such as periods of rapid price increase or stability in boroughs with higher Asian Indian populations.\n  - Identify any outliers where house price trends deviate significantly from the general trend observed across other boroughs.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- Use statistical tests (e.g., t-tests or ANOVA) to determine if the differences in house price trends between high and low Asian Indian percentage boroughs are statistically significant.\n- Report p-values to assess the likelihood that observed patterns are due to chance.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- Ensure the accuracy and completeness of the datasets, particularly focusing on the consistency of area names and the temporal coverage of house price data.\n- Address any missing or anomalous data points that could skew the analysis.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- Use interactive line charts to allow users to explore house price trends over time for each borough, with the ability to overlay or filter by Asian Indian percentage.\n- Highlight key periods of change or stability in house prices, and annotate significant events or policy changes that may have influenced these trends.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Assumptions:**\n  - The analysis assumes that the percentage of Asian Indian ethnicity is a stable proxy over the time period considered, despite using 2021 data.\n  - Assumes that house price trends are influenced by demographic factors, though other economic and policy factors also play significant roles.\n\n- **Limitations:**\n  - The analysis is limited by the granularity of the ethnicity data, which is only available for 2021.\n  - Potential confounding variables such as income levels, employment rates, and housing policies are not directly accounted for in this analysis.\n\nBy following this methodology, the analysis aims to provide actionable insights into the relationship between ethnicity demographics and house price trends in London boroughs, while acknowledging the limitations and assumptions inherent in the data.",
