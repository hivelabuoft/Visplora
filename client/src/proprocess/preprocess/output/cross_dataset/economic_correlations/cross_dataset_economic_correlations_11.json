  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**\n   - Extract the private rent prices for each borough in London for the year 2023 using the provided query on the `rent_data` dataset.\n   - Extract the number of libraries for each borough for the years 2022 and 2023 using the provided query on the `library_data` dataset.\n   - Ensure both datasets are aligned by borough names to facilitate accurate correlation analysis.\n\n2. **Data Alignment:**\n   - Temporally align the datasets by focusing on the most recent data available for libraries (2023) to compare with the 2023 rent data.\n   - Normalize the library data to a per capita basis if population data is available, or use the raw count if not.\n\n3. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between private rent prices and the number of libraries per capita for each borough.\n   - Use this metric to determine the strength and direction of the relationship.\n\n4. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Conduct a hypothesis test to evaluate the statistical significance of the correlation.\n   - Use a p-value threshold (commonly 0.05) to determine if the observed correlation is statistically significant.\n\n5. **Visualization:**\n   - Create a bar chart where each borough is a category, with two bars representing private rent prices and libraries per capita.\n   - Highlight any significant patterns or outliers in the visualization.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Results:**\n  - The Pearson correlation coefficient will indicate whether there is a positive, negative, or no correlation between rent prices and libraries per capita.\n  - A negative correlation would support the proposition that higher rent prices are associated with fewer libraries per capita.\n\n- **Statistical Significance:**\n  - If the p-value is less than 0.05, the correlation is statistically significant, supporting the proposition.\n  - Otherwise, the correlation may be due to random chance.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r):** Measures the linear relationship between two variables.\n- **P-value:** Assesses the probability that the observed correlation occurred by chance.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- Ensure data accuracy and completeness, particularly in borough names and values.\n- Consider potential data entry errors or missing data that could affect the analysis.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- Use a bar chart with dual axes to clearly depict both rent prices and library counts per capita.\n- Include labels and a legend for clarity, and consider color-coding to differentiate between the two datasets.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Temporal Discrepancy:** The library data spans two years, which may introduce variability not present in the single-year rent data.\n- **Population Data:** If per capita calculations are used, ensure population data is accurate and from the same timeframe.\n- **Causation vs. Correlation:** The analysis identifies correlation, not causation. Other factors may influence both rent prices and library counts.\n\n### Actionable Insights\n\n- If a significant negative correlation is found, urban planners and policymakers might explore the impact of rent prices on public amenities like libraries.\n- Further research could investigate underlying causes or additional factors contributing to the observed relationship.\n\nBy following this methodology, you can effectively analyze and visualize the relationship between private rent prices and library availability in London boroughs, providing valuable insights for urban planning and policy development.",
