  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**\n   - Extract school performance data for 2023 from the `school_data` dataset using the query:\n     ```sql\n     SELECT area AS area, performance_score AS value FROM school_data WHERE date = 2023\n     ```\n   - Extract mean income data for 2023 from the `income_data` dataset using the query:\n     ```sql\n     SELECT area AS Area, mean_income AS Mean_income FROM income_data WHERE year = 2023\n     ```\n   - Ensure both datasets are aligned by the `area` field, which represents the boroughs in London.\n\n2. **Data Integration:**\n   - Perform an inner join on the two datasets using the `area` field to ensure that only boroughs present in both datasets are included in the analysis.\n\n3. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient to quantify the linear relationship between school performance scores and mean income levels across boroughs.\n   - Visualize the relationship using a scatter plot to observe the distribution and potential trends.\n\n4. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Conduct hypothesis testing to determine the statistical significance of the correlation. A p-value less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.\n\n5. **Outlier Detection:**\n   - Identify any boroughs that significantly deviate from the observed trend, which could indicate unique circumstances or data anomalies.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Coefficient:** The Pearson correlation coefficient will provide a measure of the strength and direction of the relationship. A positive value indicates that higher school performance is associated with higher mean income levels.\n- **Scatter Plot Visualization:** The scatter plot will visually represent each borough as a point, with school performance on the x-axis and mean income on the y-axis. A line of best fit can be added to illustrate the trend.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **P-Value:** Calculate the p-value associated with the correlation coefficient to assess the likelihood that the observed correlation is due to random chance. A p-value below 0.05 indicates statistical significance.\n- **Confidence Interval:** Provide a confidence interval for the correlation coefficient to understand the precision of the estimate.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Completeness:** Ensure that both datasets have complete data for all boroughs. Missing data could bias the results.\n- **Accuracy:** Verify the accuracy of the data sources, especially the performance scores and income figures, to ensure they are reliable.\n- **Temporal Alignment:** Confirm that both datasets are from the same year (2023) to maintain temporal consistency.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Scatter Plot:** Use a scatter plot to display the relationship between school performance and mean income. Include labels for each borough to identify outliers or specific trends.\n- **Trend Line:** Add a line of best fit to the scatter plot to highlight the overall trend.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Causality:** The analysis identifies correlation, not causation. Higher income may lead to better school performance, or vice versa, but this cannot be determined from correlation alone.\n- **Data Limitations:** The analysis assumes that the datasets are comprehensive and accurately reflect the current state of school performance and income levels.\n- **External Factors:** Other factors not included in the datasets, such as government policies or socio-economic changes, could influence the observed relationship.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"scatter\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"x\": \"schools-colleges_value\",\n      \"y\": \"income_value\",\n      \"borough\": \"area_name\",\n      \"dataset1\": \"schools-colleges\",\n      \"dataset2\": \"income\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis output structure will be used to generate the scatter plot, with each borough represented as a data point, facilitating the visualization of the relationship between school performance and income levels.",
