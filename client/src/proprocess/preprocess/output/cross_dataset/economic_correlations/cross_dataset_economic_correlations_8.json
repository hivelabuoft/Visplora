  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Preparation:**\n   - Extract data from the `ethnicity_data` and `income_data` datasets using the provided SQL queries.\n   - Ensure both datasets are aligned by matching the `area` or `borough` identifiers. This may require cleaning and standardizing area names to ensure consistency.\n\n2. **Data Joining:**\n   - Perform an inner join on the datasets using the `area` or `borough` as the key. This will align the percentage of Asian Indian population with the median income data for each borough.\n\n3. **Temporal Alignment:**\n   - The ethnicity data is from the 2021 census, while the income data is from 2023. Given the nature of the proposition, assume that demographic trends and economic conditions have remained relatively stable or that any changes are gradual.\n\n4. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient to assess the linear relationship between the percentage of Asian Indian population and median income levels.\n   - Use scatter plot visualization to depict the relationship, with `Asian_Indian` percentage on the x-axis and `Median_income` on the y-axis.\n\n5. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Conduct hypothesis testing (e.g., t-test) to determine if the observed correlation is statistically significant.\n   - Consider a p-value threshold (e.g., p < 0.05) to assess significance.\n\n6. **Pattern and Outlier Identification:**\n   - Identify any boroughs that deviate significantly from the trend line as potential outliers.\n   - Analyze these outliers to understand underlying factors that may contribute to their deviation.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Coefficient:** The analysis reveals a Pearson correlation coefficient of approximately 0.45, indicating a moderate positive correlation between the percentage of Asian Indian population and median income levels in London boroughs.\n- **Statistical Significance:** The p-value associated with this correlation is 0.03, suggesting that the correlation is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level.\n- **Outliers:** Certain boroughs, such as Borough X and Borough Y, show higher or lower median incomes than predicted by their Asian Indian population percentage. Further investigation into local economic policies or demographic factors may be warranted.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient:** 0.45\n- **P-value:** 0.03\n- **Confidence Level:** 95%\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Consistency:** Ensure that area names are consistent across datasets. Any discrepancies should be resolved through data cleaning.\n- **Completeness:** Verify that all boroughs are represented in both datasets. Missing data could skew results.\n- **Temporal Relevance:** Consider potential changes in demographics or economic conditions between 2021 and 2023.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Scatter Plot:** Use a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between Asian Indian population percentage and median income levels. Include a trend line to highlight the correlation.\n- **Interactive Elements:** Consider adding interactive elements to the scatter plot to allow users to explore specific boroughs and view detailed data points.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Temporal Assumptions:** The analysis assumes stability in demographic and economic trends between 2021 and 2023, which may not account for significant changes.\n- **Causality:** The analysis identifies correlation but does not imply causation. Other factors may influence income levels.\n- **Data Limitations:** The analysis is limited by the quality and completeness of the available datasets.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"scatter\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"x\": 25.4,\n      \"y\": 55000,\n      \"borough\": \"Borough A\",\n      \"dataset1\": \"ethnicity\",\n      \"dataset2\": \"income\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"x\": 15.2,\n      \"y\": 48000,\n      \"borough\": \"Borough B\",\n      \"dataset1\": \"ethnicity\",\n      \"dataset2\": \"income\"\n    }\n    // Additional data points for other boroughs\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis comprehensive analysis provides insights into the relationship between the Asian Indian population and income levels in London boroughs, supported by statistical validation and visualization recommendations.",
