  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Preparation:**\n   - Extract crime data for each borough from 2022 to 2023, focusing on total crime counts per borough.\n   - Extract median income data for each borough for the year 2023.\n   - Ensure both datasets are aligned by borough names, using a common identifier (e.g., borough_name or Area).\n\n2. **Data Integration:**\n   - Perform an inner join on the two datasets using the borough name as the key.\n   - Aggregate crime data to get total crime counts per borough for the specified period.\n\n3. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between total crime counts and median income levels across boroughs.\n   - Use the correlation coefficient to assess the strength and direction of the relationship.\n\n4. **Visualization:**\n   - Create a scatter plot with crime rates on the x-axis and median income on the y-axis.\n   - Each point on the plot represents a borough, labeled accordingly.\n\n5. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Conduct a hypothesis test (e.g., t-test) to determine the statistical significance of the correlation.\n   - Calculate the p-value to assess the likelihood that the observed correlation is due to chance.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Coefficient:** A negative Pearson correlation coefficient would suggest that higher crime rates are associated with lower median income levels across London boroughs.\n- **Significant Patterns:** If the correlation is statistically significant (p-value < 0.05), it indicates a meaningful relationship between crime rates and income levels.\n- **Outliers:** Identify boroughs that do not follow the general trend, which could indicate unique socio-economic conditions or data anomalies.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r):** Quantifies the degree of linear relationship between crime rates and income.\n- **P-value:** Determines the statistical significance of the correlation. A p-value less than 0.05 typically indicates a significant correlation.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Data Completeness:** Ensure no missing data for any borough in either dataset.\n- **Data Consistency:** Verify that borough names are consistent across datasets.\n- **Temporal Alignment:** Confirm that the crime data covers the entire period from 2022 to 2023, and income data is specifically for 2023.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Scatter Plot:** Use a scatter plot to visually represent the relationship between crime rates and median income.\n- **Annotations:** Label each point with the borough name for easy identification.\n- **Trend Line:** Include a trend line to illustrate the overall direction of the relationship.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Causality:** Correlation does not imply causation. Other factors may influence both crime rates and income levels.\n- **Data Limitations:** The analysis is limited to available data; any missing or inaccurate data could affect results.\n- **Temporal Misalignment:** Income data is for 2023, while crime data spans two years. Assumptions are made that income levels have not drastically changed within this period.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"scatter\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"x\": \"crime-rates_value\",\n      \"y\": \"income_value\",\n      \"borough\": \"area_name\",\n      \"dataset1\": \"crime-rates\",\n      \"dataset2\": \"income\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis structured output will facilitate the creation of a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between crime rates and median income levels across London boroughs.",
