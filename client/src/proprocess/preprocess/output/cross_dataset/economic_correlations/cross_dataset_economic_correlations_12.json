  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Preparation:**\n   - **Ethnicity Data:** Extract the percentage of White British ethnicity from the 2021 census data for each LSOA (Lower Layer Super Output Area) in London.\n   - **House Prices Data:** Obtain the average house prices for each area in London for the year 2023.\n   - **Data Integration:** Match the LSOA codes from the ethnicity dataset with the corresponding areas in the house prices dataset. This involves ensuring that the geographic identifiers (LSOA codes) are consistent across both datasets.\n\n2. **Temporal Alignment:**\n   - Although the ethnicity data is from 2021 and the house prices are from 2023, the relationship type is a proxy, suggesting that the ethnic composition is a stable characteristic that can be reasonably assumed to influence or correlate with house prices over a short period.\n\n3. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the percentage of White British ethnicity and house prices.\n   - Perform a regression analysis to further explore the relationship and quantify the impact of ethnicity on house prices.\n\n4. **Pattern and Outlier Identification:**\n   - Use scatter plots to visually inspect the relationship and identify any boroughs that significantly deviate from the trend.\n\n5. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Conduct hypothesis testing to determine the statistical significance of the observed correlation.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Coefficient:** The Pearson correlation coefficient indicates the degree of linear relationship between the percentage of White British residents and house prices. A positive value suggests a direct relationship, while a negative value suggests an inverse relationship.\n- **Regression Analysis:** The regression line provides insights into how much house prices are expected to change with a unit change in the percentage of White British residents.\n- **Outliers:** Identify boroughs that do not follow the general trend, which may indicate unique local factors affecting house prices.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **P-Value:** Determine the p-value from the correlation analysis to assess the statistical significance. A p-value less than 0.05 typically indicates a statistically significant relationship.\n- **Confidence Intervals:** Calculate confidence intervals for the regression coefficients to understand the precision of the estimates.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Data Completeness:** Ensure that both datasets are complete and cover all relevant areas in London.\n- **Data Consistency:** Verify that the geographic identifiers are consistent across datasets to avoid mismatches.\n- **Temporal Relevance:** Consider any significant demographic changes between 2021 and 2023 that might affect the analysis.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Scatter Plot:** Create a scatter plot with the percentage of White British ethnicity on the x-axis and house prices on the y-axis. Each point represents a borough, and the plot should include a regression line to illustrate the trend.\n- **Color Coding:** Use color coding to differentiate between boroughs or highlight outliers.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Temporal Assumption:** The analysis assumes that the ethnic composition of boroughs has not significantly changed between 2021 and 2023.\n- **Causality vs. Correlation:** The analysis identifies correlation, not causation. Other factors may influence house prices.\n- **Data Granularity:** The analysis is limited by the granularity of the available data, which may not capture intra-borough variations.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"scatter\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"x\": \"ethnicity_value\",\n      \"y\": \"house-prices_value\",\n      \"borough\": \"area_name\",\n      \"dataset1\": \"ethnicity\",\n      \"dataset2\": \"house-prices\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis structure facilitates the visualization of the relationship between ethnicity and house prices, aiding in the identification of trends and outliers.",
