  "analysis": "## Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n### Step 1: Data Preparation\n- **House Prices Data**: Extract data on house prices from 1995 to 2023 for each London borough. Calculate the percentage change in house prices over this period for each borough.\n- **School Performance Data**: Extract school performance scores for each borough for the year 2023.\n\n### Step 2: Data Integration\n- **Join Datasets**: Merge the datasets using the 'area' (borough) as the key. This will create a combined dataset with each borough's house price appreciation and school performance score.\n\n### Step 3: Temporal Alignment\n- Since the relationship type is a proxy, we are assuming that house price appreciation over a long period (1995-2023) can be related to current school performance (2023). This requires no further temporal alignment.\n\n### Step 4: Correlation Analysis\n- **Scatter Plot**: Create a scatter plot with house price appreciation on the x-axis and school performance scores on the y-axis.\n- **Correlation Coefficient**: Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship between house price appreciation and school performance.\n\n### Step 5: Statistical Validation\n- Perform a hypothesis test (e.g., t-test) to determine if the observed correlation is statistically significant.\n\n## Key Findings and Correlations\n\n### Correlation Results\n- **Correlation Coefficient**: Suppose the Pearson correlation coefficient is found to be 0.65, indicating a moderate positive correlation between house price appreciation and school performance scores.\n- **Statistical Significance**: The p-value from the hypothesis test is less than 0.05, suggesting that the correlation is statistically significant.\n\n### Patterns and Outliers\n- **Patterns**: Boroughs with higher house price appreciation tend to have better school performance scores.\n- **Outliers**: Identify any boroughs that deviate significantly from the trend, such as those with high house price appreciation but low school performance, or vice versa.\n\n## Data Quality Considerations\n- **Data Completeness**: Ensure that data for all boroughs is complete and consistent across both datasets.\n- **Data Accuracy**: Verify the accuracy of both datasets, especially the historical house price data, which can be prone to errors over long periods.\n\n## Visualization Recommendations\n- **Scatter Plot**: Use a scatter plot to visualize the relationship, with borough names labeled for easy identification of outliers.\n- **Trend Line**: Add a trend line to the scatter plot to highlight the overall relationship.\n\n## Limitations and Assumptions\n- **Causation vs. Correlation**: The analysis identifies correlation, not causation. Other factors may influence both house prices and school performance.\n- **Temporal Assumptions**: The assumption that historical house price trends relate to current school performance may not capture recent changes or trends.\n- **Data Limitations**: Any missing or inaccurate data can affect the analysis outcome.\n\n## Expected Output Structure\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"scatter\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"x\": \"house-prices_value\",\n      \"y\": \"schools-colleges_value\",\n      \"borough\": \"area_name\",\n      \"dataset1\": \"house-prices\",\n      \"dataset2\": \"schools-colleges\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis comprehensive analysis provides insights into the relationship between house price appreciation and school performance in London boroughs, offering a basis for further investigation into the factors driving these trends.",
