  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**\n   - Extract crime data for each borough from the `crime_data` dataset for the years 2022-2023.\n   - Extract library data for each area from the `library_data` dataset for the same period.\n   - Ensure both datasets are aligned temporally and geographically by matching borough names with area names.\n\n2. **Data Normalization:**\n   - Normalize crime rates and library counts by population to obtain per capita values. This ensures comparability across boroughs of different sizes.\n\n3. **Data Integration:**\n   - Join the datasets on the common field of borough/area names.\n   - Calculate the total crime rate per capita and the number of libraries per capita for each borough.\n\n4. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Use Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the linear relationship between crime rates per capita and libraries per capita.\n   - Consider using Spearman's rank correlation as a non-parametric measure if the data distribution is not normal.\n\n5. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Perform hypothesis testing to determine the statistical significance of the correlation.\n   - Use a p-value threshold (e.g., p < 0.05) to assess significance.\n\n6. **Visualization:**\n   - Create a bar chart to visualize the relationship between crime rates and library counts per capita for each borough.\n   - Highlight any significant correlations or outliers.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Results:**\n  - Calculate the correlation coefficient (r). A negative value would suggest that higher crime rates are associated with fewer libraries per capita.\n  - Analyze the strength of the correlation: strong (|r| > 0.7), moderate (0.3 < |r| < 0.7), or weak (|r| < 0.3).\n\n- **Significant Patterns:**\n  - Identify boroughs with notably high crime rates and low library counts, or vice versa.\n  - Highlight any outliers that deviate significantly from the overall trend.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **P-Value:**\n  - Report the p-value associated with the correlation coefficient to assess statistical significance.\n  - A p-value less than 0.05 indicates a statistically significant correlation.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Data Completeness:**\n  - Ensure both datasets are complete and cover all boroughs for the specified period.\n  - Address any missing data through imputation or exclusion if necessary.\n\n- **Data Accuracy:**\n  - Verify the accuracy of crime and library data by cross-referencing with official reports or datasets.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Bar Chart:**\n  - Use a dual-axis bar chart to display crime rates and library counts per capita for each borough.\n  - Different colors can represent crime rates and library counts to enhance clarity.\n\n- **Highlighting:**\n  - Use annotations or color coding to highlight significant correlations or outliers.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Assumptions:**\n  - Assume that the datasets accurately represent the true crime rates and library counts for each borough.\n  - Assume population data used for normalization is accurate and up-to-date.\n\n- **Limitations:**\n  - Correlation does not imply causation; further analysis is needed to understand underlying factors.\n  - Data may not account for all variables influencing crime rates or library distribution, such as socio-economic factors.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"bar\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"category\": \"Borough A\",\n      \"value1\": 0.25,  // Crime rate per capita\n      \"value2\": 0.05,  // Libraries per capita\n      \"comparison_type\": \"correlation\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"category\": \"Borough B\",\n      \"value1\": 0.30,\n      \"value2\": 0.03,\n      \"comparison_type\": \"correlation\"\n    }\n    // Additional boroughs...\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis structured output provides a clear visualization of the relationship between crime rates and library availability across London boroughs, facilitating further analysis and policy-making.",
