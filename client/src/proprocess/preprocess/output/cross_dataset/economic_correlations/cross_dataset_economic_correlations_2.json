  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**\n   - Extract population data for each London borough from 1990 to 2021.\n   - Extract house price data for each London borough from 1995 to 2023.\n   - Align datasets by borough to facilitate direct comparison.\n\n2. **Temporal Alignment:**\n   - Identify overlapping time periods for both datasets (1995-2021).\n   - Ensure data is aggregated annually to maintain consistency in temporal analysis.\n\n3. **Data Integration:**\n   - Merge datasets based on the 'area' (borough) and align by year.\n   - Calculate percentage change in population and house prices over the specified periods.\n\n4. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Use Pearson correlation coefficient to assess the relationship between population growth and house price changes.\n   - Analyze the correlation on a borough-by-borough basis to identify local variations.\n\n5. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Perform hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests) to determine the significance of observed correlations.\n   - Use p-values to assess the statistical significance of the correlation results.\n\n6. **Pattern and Outlier Identification:**\n   - Identify boroughs with significant deviations from the overall trend.\n   - Use z-scores to detect outliers in both population growth and house price changes.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Overall Correlation:**\n  - A moderate to strong positive correlation is generally expected between population growth and house price increases.\n  - Boroughs with higher population growth rates tend to exhibit more substantial increases in house prices.\n\n- **Significant Boroughs:**\n  - Central boroughs like Westminster and Camden may show stronger correlations due to high demand and limited housing supply.\n  - Outer boroughs may exhibit weaker correlations due to more available land for development.\n\n- **Outliers:**\n  - Identify boroughs with unexpected trends, such as high population growth but stagnant house prices, or vice versa.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r):** Measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship.\n- **P-value:** Determines the statistical significance of the correlation. A p-value < 0.05 typically indicates significance.\n- **Confidence Intervals:** Provide a range within which the true correlation likely falls.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Completeness:** Ensure datasets are complete and cover all boroughs consistently.\n- **Accuracy:** Verify data accuracy, especially for historical records.\n- **Consistency:** Check for consistent data collection methods across years.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Line Chart:**\n  - Plot population growth and house price changes over time for each borough.\n  - Use dual axes to represent both variables clearly.\n  - Highlight significant trends and outliers with annotations.\n\n- **Heatmap:**\n  - Visualize correlation coefficients across boroughs to identify areas with the strongest relationships.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Temporal Gaps:** Assumes consistent data availability across all years.\n- **External Factors:** Does not account for external influences such as economic policies or global events impacting house prices.\n- **Linear Relationship Assumption:** Assumes a linear relationship between population growth and house prices, which may not capture non-linear dynamics.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis analysis provides a comprehensive view of the relationship between population growth and house price changes across London boroughs. By understanding these dynamics, policymakers and urban planners can better address housing demand and affordability challenges. The insights derived from this analysis can inform strategic decisions to manage urban growth effectively.",
