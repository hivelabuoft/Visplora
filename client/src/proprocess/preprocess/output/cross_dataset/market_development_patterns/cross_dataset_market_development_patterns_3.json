  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**\n   - Extract income data for London boroughs from 1999 to 2023 using the provided SQL query.\n   - Extract private rent data for London boroughs from 2011 to the present using the provided SQL query.\n   - Ensure both datasets are cleaned and formatted consistently, focusing on the 'Area' field for alignment.\n\n2. **Temporal Alignment:**\n   - Align the datasets by year, focusing on the overlapping period from 2011 to 2023. This ensures that income growth can be compared with rent price changes over the same timeframe.\n\n3. **Data Integration:**\n   - Join the datasets on the 'Area' field and the 'Year'/'Date' field to create a unified dataset that includes both income and rent price data for each borough and year.\n\n4. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Calculate the percentage change in mean income for each borough from 1999 to 2023.\n   - Calculate the percentage change in private rent prices for each borough from 2011 to the present.\n   - Use Pearson correlation coefficients to assess the relationship between income growth and rent price changes across boroughs.\n\n5. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Perform hypothesis testing to determine the statistical significance of the observed correlations.\n   - Use p-values to assess the likelihood that the observed correlations are due to chance.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Results:**\n  - A moderate to strong positive correlation is expected between income growth and rent price increases, indicating that boroughs with higher income growth tend to experience higher rent increases.\n  - Specific boroughs may exhibit stronger correlations, highlighting areas where income growth has a more pronounced impact on rent prices.\n\n- **Significant Patterns:**\n  - Boroughs with the highest income growth rates often align with those experiencing the most significant rent increases, suggesting a direct relationship between economic prosperity and housing market dynamics.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient:** Used to quantify the strength and direction of the relationship between income growth and rent price changes.\n- **P-Value:** Assesses the probability that the observed correlation occurred by chance. A p-value less than 0.05 typically indicates statistical significance.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Consistency:** Ensure that all data points are consistently formatted and free from errors or missing values.\n- **Temporal Coverage:** Verify that the datasets cover the entire specified period without gaps.\n- **Outliers:** Identify and assess any outliers that may skew the analysis.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Line Chart:**\n  - Plot a line chart with dual axes to visualize income growth and rent price changes over time for each borough.\n  - Use different colors or line styles to differentiate between income and rent data.\n  - Highlight key boroughs with significant trends or deviations.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Data Availability:** Assumes complete and accurate data for all boroughs and years within the specified timeframe.\n- **Causality vs. Correlation:** The analysis identifies correlations but does not establish causality. Other factors may influence rent prices beyond income growth.\n- **Economic Factors:** External economic conditions, such as inflation or policy changes, are not accounted for in this analysis but may impact results.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"line\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"time\": \"2011-2023\",\n      \"value1\": \"income_value\",\n      \"value2\": \"private-rent_value\",\n      \"area\": \"area_name\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis output structure will be used to generate a line chart that visualizes the relationship between income growth and rent price changes across London boroughs, providing actionable insights for urban planners and policymakers.",
