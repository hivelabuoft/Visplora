  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**\n   - Extract income data from 1999 to 2023 for each borough using the provided SQL query.\n   - Extract house price data from 1995 to the present using the provided SQL query.\n   - Ensure both datasets are cleaned and standardized, focusing on consistent area naming conventions.\n\n2. **Data Integration:**\n   - Join the datasets on the common field \"Area\" (borough).\n   - Align the temporal data by creating a common time frame from 1999 to the present, as income data starts from 1999.\n\n3. **Temporal Alignment:**\n   - Calculate the mean income for each borough over the period 1999-2023.\n   - Calculate the percentage change in house prices for each borough from 1999 to the present.\n\n4. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Use Pearson correlation to assess the relationship between mean income and house price appreciation for each borough.\n   - Calculate the correlation coefficient to determine the strength and direction of the relationship.\n\n5. **Pattern Identification:**\n   - Identify boroughs with significant deviations from the overall trend, marking them as outliers.\n   - Analyze the data for any boroughs where high income does not correlate with high house price appreciation.\n\n6. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Perform hypothesis testing to validate the correlation findings, using a significance level (e.g., p-value < 0.05).\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Coefficient:** A positive correlation coefficient suggests that boroughs with higher mean incomes tend to have greater house price appreciation.\n- **Outliers:** Identify boroughs where the correlation does not hold, potentially due to unique economic or social factors.\n- **Significant Patterns:** Boroughs with tech hubs or significant infrastructure investments may show stronger correlations.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient:** Quantifies the degree of linear relationship between income and house price appreciation.\n- **P-Value:** Used to test the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between income and house price appreciation.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Consistency:** Ensure area names are consistent across datasets.\n- **Completeness:** Verify that all boroughs have data for the entire period.\n- **Accuracy:** Cross-check data with external sources to ensure reliability.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Line Chart:** Plot mean income and house price appreciation over time for each borough.\n- **Dual Axis Chart:** Use one axis for income and another for house price appreciation to visualize correlations.\n- **Highlight Outliers:** Use different colors or markers to highlight boroughs that deviate from the trend.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Temporal Coverage:** The analysis assumes that the temporal alignment from 1999 onwards is sufficient to capture trends.\n- **Data Gaps:** Any missing data points could affect the accuracy of the correlation analysis.\n- **External Factors:** The analysis does not account for external factors like policy changes or global economic events that could impact house prices.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"line\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"time\": \"1999-2023\",\n      \"value1\": \"mean_income\",\n      \"value2\": \"house_price_appreciation\",\n      \"area\": \"borough_name\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis comprehensive analysis provides a structured approach to understanding the relationship between income and house price appreciation in London boroughs, offering insights that can inform urban planning and economic policy decisions.",
