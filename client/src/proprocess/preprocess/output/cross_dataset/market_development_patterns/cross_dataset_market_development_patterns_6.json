  "analysis": "### Cross-Dataset Analysis Methodology\n\n1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**\n   - Extract data from the `library_data` and `school_data` datasets for the years 2022 and 2023.\n   - Ensure both datasets have a common key, which is the `area` or borough name, to facilitate joining.\n\n2. **Data Cleaning and Alignment:**\n   - Check for any missing or inconsistent data entries in both datasets. Handle missing data through imputation or exclusion based on the extent of missingness.\n   - Ensure temporal alignment by confirming that the data points from both datasets correspond to the same time periods.\n\n3. **Data Integration:**\n   - Join the datasets on the `area` field to create a combined dataset that includes the number of libraries and school performance scores for each borough.\n\n4. **Correlation Analysis:**\n   - Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient to assess the strength and direction of the relationship between the number of libraries and school performance scores across boroughs.\n   - Use scatter plots to visually inspect the relationship and identify any patterns or outliers.\n\n5. **Statistical Validation:**\n   - Perform hypothesis testing (e.g., t-test) to determine if the observed correlation is statistically significant.\n   - Consider a p-value threshold (commonly 0.05) to evaluate significance.\n\n### Key Findings and Correlations\n\n- **Correlation Coefficient:** The Pearson correlation coefficient will indicate the strength and direction of the relationship. A positive value suggests that more libraries are associated with higher school performance scores, while a negative value suggests the opposite.\n- **Significant Patterns:** Identify boroughs that deviate significantly from the trend, which may indicate unique factors affecting either libraries or school performance.\n- **Outliers:** Highlight any boroughs with exceptionally high or low values in either dataset that could skew the analysis.\n\n### Statistical Significance Measures\n\n- **P-Value:** Calculate the p-value to assess the statistical significance of the correlation. A p-value less than 0.05 typically indicates a statistically significant relationship.\n- **Confidence Intervals:** Provide confidence intervals for the correlation coefficient to understand the precision of the estimate.\n\n### Data Quality Considerations\n\n- **Data Completeness:** Ensure that both datasets are complete and represent all boroughs for the specified period.\n- **Data Consistency:** Verify that the data definitions and measurement methods are consistent across datasets.\n- **Temporal Consistency:** Confirm that the data points align temporally to ensure valid comparisons.\n\n### Visualization Recommendations\n\n- **Scatter Plot:** Create a scatter plot with the number of libraries on the x-axis and school performance scores on the y-axis. Each point represents a borough.\n- **Color Coding:** Use color coding to differentiate between boroughs or highlight specific categories (e.g., school types).\n- **Trend Line:** Include a trend line to visualize the overall relationship and direction of the correlation.\n\n### Limitations and Assumptions\n\n- **Causality:** Correlation does not imply causation. The analysis identifies relationships but does not determine the cause.\n- **External Factors:** Consider other factors that might influence school performance, such as socio-economic status, funding, or policy changes.\n- **Data Limitations:** The analysis is limited to the available data for 2022-2023 and may not capture long-term trends or changes.\n\n### Expected Output Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"scatter\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"x\": \"libraries_value\",\n      \"y\": \"schools-colleges_value\",\n      \"borough\": \"area_name\",\n      \"dataset1\": \"libraries\",\n      \"dataset2\": \"schools-colleges\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis output structure will facilitate the visualization of the relationship between the number of libraries and school performance scores across London boroughs, providing actionable insights for stakeholders.",
