DETAILED RESULTS:
--------------------
ID: crime-rates_temporal_trends_temp_001
Dataset: crime-rates
Status: fixed
Issues: 1. The `date` column in the dataset uses the "YYYY-MM" format, not full dates like "YYYY-MM-DD". The original query incorrectly uses the full date format in the `BETWEEN` clause.
2. The `count` column is not listed in the available columns, which suggests it might not exist. The query attempts to sum a non-existent column.
Original SQL: SELECT date AS time, SUM(count) AS value FROM crime_data WHERE date BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2023-12-31' GROUP BY date ORDER BY date;
Fixed SQL: ```sql
SELECT date AS time, COUNT(*) AS value 
FROM crime_data 
WHERE date BETWEEN '2022-01' AND '2023-12' 
GROUP BY date 
ORDER BY date;
```

ID: house-prices_temporal_trends_tt_001
Dataset: house-prices
Status: fixed
Issues: 1. The table name `house_price_data` does not match the dataset structure provided.
2. The column names `date`, `average_price`, and `area_name` do not exist in the dataset. The correct columns are `Year`, `Value`, and `Area`.
3. The `Year` column format is "Year ending Dec 1995", which is not compatible with the `BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'` date filtering.
4. The `GROUP BY` clause is incorrect because it uses non-existent columns and does not match the dataset structure.
Original SQL: SELECT date AS time, average_price AS value FROM house_price_data WHERE date BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2023-12-31' GROUP BY date, area_name ORDER BY date;
Fixed SQL: ```sql
SELECT 
    Year AS time, 
    Value AS value 
FROM 
    house_prices 
WHERE 
    Year BETWEEN 'Year ending Dec 2020' AND 'Year ending Dec 2023' 
GROUP BY 
    Year, Area 
ORDER BY 
    Year;
```

ID: population_temporal_trends_tt1
Dataset: population
Status: fixed
Issues: 1. The dataset does not have a 'date' column; instead, it has columns for each year as individual columns (e.g., '2001', '2011').
2. The original query assumes a date range filtering, which is not applicable since the dataset uses year columns.
3. The table name 'population_data' does not match the dataset structure provided.
4. The query needs to be adjusted to sum across the relevant year columns.
Original SQL: SELECT date AS time, SUM(population_count) AS value FROM population_data WHERE date BETWEEN '2000-01-01' AND '2020-12-31' GROUP BY date ORDER BY date;
Fixed SQL: ```sql
SELECT 
    '2001' AS time, SUM(CAST(REPLACE("2001", ',', '') AS INTEGER)) AS value 
FROM 
    population_data
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    '2011' AS time, SUM(CAST(REPLACE("2011", ',', '') AS INTEGER)) AS value 
FROM 
    population_data
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    '2021' AS time, SUM(CAST(REPLACE("2021", ',', '') AS INTEGER)) AS value 
FROM 
    population_data
ORDER BY 
    time;
```

ID: vehicles_categorical_analysis_ca1
Dataset: vehicles
Status: fixed
Issues: 1. The original query uses a column `date` which does not exist in the dataset. The dataset does not have a date column, so filtering by year is not applicable.
2. The original query uses `vehicle_type` and `registration_count` columns, which do not exist in the dataset. The dataset has specific vehicle type columns like `Cars`, `Motor cycles`, etc.
3. The aggregation logic needs to be adjusted to sum across the specific vehicle type columns.
Original SQL: SELECT vehicle_type AS category, SUM(registration_count) AS value, (SUM(registration_count) * 100.0 / (SELECT SUM(registration_count) FROM vehicle_data WHERE YEAR(date) = 2023)) AS percentage FROM vehicle_data WHERE YEAR(date) = 2023 GROUP BY vehicle_type ORDER BY value DESC;
Fixed SQL: ```sql
SELECT 
    'Cars' AS category, 
    SUM(Cars) AS value, 
    (SUM(Cars) * 100.0 / SUM(Total)) AS percentage 
FROM vehicle_data
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Motor cycles' AS category, 
    SUM(Motor cycles) AS value, 
    (SUM(Motor cycles) * 100.0 / SUM(Total)) AS percentage 
FROM vehicle_data
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Light goods' AS category, 
    SUM(Light goods) AS value, 
    (SUM(Light goods) * 100.0 / SUM(Total)) AS percentage 
FROM vehicle_data
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Heavy goods' AS category, 
    SUM(Heavy goods) AS value, 
    (SUM(Heavy goods) * 100.0 / SUM(Total)) AS percentage 
FROM vehicle_data
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Buses and coaches' AS category, 
    SUM(Buses and coaches) AS value, 
    (SUM(Buses and coaches) * 100.0 / SUM(Total)) AS percentage 
FROM vehicle_data
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Other vehicles' AS category, 
    SUM(Other vehicles) AS value, 
    (SUM(Other vehicles) * 100.0 / SUM(Total)) AS percentage 
FROM vehicle_data
ORDER BY value DESC;
```
----------------------------------------
ID: private-rent_temporal_trends_tt1
Dataset: private-rent
Status: fixed
Issues: 1. The original query uses a column named `date`, which does not exist in the dataset. The dataset has a `Quarter` column that likely represents time.
2. The column `average_rent` does not exist; the correct column name is `Average`.
3. The table name `rent_data` is incorrect; the dataset does not specify a table name, but we will assume it should be `private_rent` based on the context.
4. The expected output structure requires a `time` field, which should be derived from the `Quarter` column.
5. The date filtering logic needs to be adjusted to use the `Quarter` column, which is in the format 'QY' (e.g., 'Q2').
Original SQL: SELECT date AS time, AVG(average_rent) AS value FROM rent_data WHERE date BETWEEN '2020-01-01' AND '2023-12-31' GROUP BY date ORDER BY date;
Fixed SQL: ```sql
SELECT 
    Quarter AS time, 
    AVG(CAST(Average AS FLOAT)) AS value 
FROM 
    private_rent 
WHERE 
    Quarter BETWEEN 'Q1' AND 'Q4' 
GROUP BY 
    Quarter 
ORDER BY 
    Quarter;
```
