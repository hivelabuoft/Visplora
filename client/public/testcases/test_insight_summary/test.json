{"id":"veh_001#G1","clicked_group_id":1,"insight_story":"From the Camden 2021 baseline, the narrative jumps to London‑wide SUVs in 2022 and then to Croydon’s overall vehicles in 2019—stacking scope, time, and attribute shifts that splinter the story into parallel insights.","data_story":"London SUVs are discussed for 2022, reflecting a subset trend at city scale, while Croydon’s 2019 all‑vehicle drop provides a separate borough/time context; these are complementary but non‑comparable views drawn from the 2019–2023 licensed‑vehicles series."},

{"id":"rent_001#G0","clicked_group_id":0,"insight_story":"The story centers on Hackney in 2023, contrasting average with median rent to show how statistic choice shapes interpretation while keeping place and time fixed.","data_story":"For 2023 Hackney, the VOA rent series supports a clean comparison of average vs median monthly levels in the same period and geography, a reporting‑ready framing that avoids scope drift and clarifies distribution effects."},
{"id":"rent_001#G1","clicked_group_id":1,"insight_story":"After establishing Hackney’s 2023 picture, the thread widens to London‑wide averages for 2023, inviting a borough‑vs‑city contrast without changing units.","data_story":"A citywide 2023 average rent view complements the Hackney slice, allowing side‑by‑side reporting at the same time unit while noting that London aggregates can conceal intra‑borough variation."},

{"id":"schools_001#G0","clicked_group_id":0,"insight_story":"We start with London secondary attendance improving in 2022–23, a city‑level, phase‑specific claim anchored to one school year.","data_story":"The 2022–23 England school information allows a London subset reading for secondary attendance, framing a single‑year change suitable for brief reporting or comparison against national benchmarks."},
{"id":"schools_001#G1","clicked_group_id":1,"insight_story":"From London’s improvement, the branch contrasts England’s slight decline and highlights Hackney’s stability, blending national and borough perspectives within the same school year.","data_story":"Within 2022–23, England’s aggregate dip and Hackney’s steady rate create a layered picture across scales; keeping the phase consistent enables a tidy compare between national, city, and borough slices."},

{"id":"crime_001#G0","clicked_group_id":0,"insight_story":"The narrative begins with Westminster up 5% in 2023—an explicit percentage‑change frame at borough level.","data_story":"Using London Crime 2022–2023, Westminster’s year‑over‑year change is presented as a percentage, a precise framing that benefits from companion views in counts or rates for corroboration."},
{"id":"crime_001#G1","clicked_group_id":1,"insight_story":"The thread then layers London total incidents and a Westminster per‑1,000 rate onto the initial %‑change claim, surfacing unit shifts that warrant parallel but distinct readings.","data_story":"For 2023, London‑wide totals (counts) and Westminster’s rate per 1,000 supply complementary metrics; aligning units across borough and city slices keeps the story coherent for publication."},

{"id":"prices_001#G1","clicked_group_id":1,"insight_story":"Next, Camden rents are said to rise in 2021, followed by an ‘overall housing costs’ inference—merging price (£) and rent (£/month) frames that should stay separate.","data_story":"Two parallel 2021 Camden stories—sale prices down and private rents up—belong in distinct lanes; a data‑driven narrative treats them as separate series rather than a single composite claim."},

{"id":"vehicles_002#G0","clicked_group_id":0,"insight_story":"The path traces Croydon’s all‑vehicle time slice: a 2020 peak followed by a slight dip ‘last year’, maintaining scope while hinting at temporal ambiguity.","data_story":"Croydon’s vehicle stock can be charted 2019–2023 to show a 2020 high and subsequent easing; making the reference year explicit stabilizes the reporting frame."},

{"id":"vague_rent_001#G0","clicked_group_id":0,"insight_story":"Hackney rents are described as ‘kind of high’ with an approximate £2k average—vague period, implied average vs possible median.","data_story":"A reporting‑oriented version fixes period and bedroom basis, then narrates average and median for the same slice to separate price level from distribution skew."},
{"id":"vague_rent_001#G1","clicked_group_id":1,"insight_story":"The lens pulls back to London being ‘lower lately’, keeping the vagueness on timing but shifting to city scale.","data_story":"Locking ‘lately’ to a concrete window, the story contrasts Hackney with London for the same months, clarifying that borough premia can coexist with city‑level easing."},

{"id":"cross_mega_001#G0","clicked_group_id":0,"insight_story":"Camden’s 2021 housing picture splits: prices dip while rents rise—two complementary but distinct signals.","data_story":"A tidy dual‑series narrative keeps 2021 Camden prices and rents side by side, explicitly separate in unit and market, to show divergence without conflation."},
{"id":"cross_mega_001#G1","clicked_group_id":1,"insight_story":"The story detours to London crime ‘last year’, shifting topic and scope with unresolved time and unit framing.","data_story":"A disciplined account isolates a citywide crime change for a resolved year, specifying counts or percent, before relating it (if at all) to the housing thread."},
{"id":"cross_mega_001#G2","clicked_group_id":2,"insight_story":"Next, England’s secondary attendance slips—national scale, same school‑year framing—marking another topic jump.","data_story":"The data story plants 2022–23 attendance at national level, comparable to London or borough slices if the phase is matched, but distinct from crime or housing."},
